Make sure that the poles are firmly secured and that the guy lines are tight. Once the tent is assembled, it’s time to secure it to the ground.</p>

<h2>Secure the Tent to the Ground</h2>

<p>Once the tent is assembled, it’s time to secure it to the ground. Start by inserting the stakes into the ground and making sure that they are firmly secured.
