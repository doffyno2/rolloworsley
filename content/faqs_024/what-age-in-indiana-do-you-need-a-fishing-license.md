In Indiana, anyone over the age of 18 is required to have a valid fishing license. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR) regulates fishing in the state, and all fishermen must abide by the rules and regulations set forth by the agency.

<h2>Who Needs a Fishing License?</h2>

Anyone over the age of 18 who wants to fish in Indiana must obtain a valid fishing license from the DNR. This includes residents and non-residents of the state. In addition, anyone under the age of 18 who is accompanied by an adult with a valid fishing license is also required to have a license.

<h2>What Types of Licenses Are Available?</h2>

The DNR offers several different types of fishing licenses. The most common type of license is the annual license, which allows for year-round fishing in all Indiana waters. In addition, the DNR offers a three-day license, a seven-day license, and a 24-hour license for those who want to fish for a shorter period of time.

<h2>Where Can You Purchase a Fishing License?</h2>

Fishing licenses can be purchased online, at your local DNR office, or at any authorized license vendor. When purchasing a license online, you will be required to provide your name, address, and other contact information. When purchasing a license in person, you may be required to show proof of residency or age.

<h2>What Are the Regulations?</h2>

In addition to the age and residency requirements, there are several regulations that all fishermen must abide by. These include limits on the number and size of fish that can be caught, and restrictions on the use of certain types of equipment. It is important to familiarize yourself with the regulations before heading out to fish.
