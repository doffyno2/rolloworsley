<h2>What Is Kraft Cheese?</h2>

<p>Kraft cheese is a processed cheese product that is made with a variety of ingredients. The main ingredient in kraft cheese is typically cheddar cheese, but other cheeses may be used as well.

<p>If you want to give your dog a treat that is both healthy and delicious, there are also a variety of dog-safe cheese treats available.
