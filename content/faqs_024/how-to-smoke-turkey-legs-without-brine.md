Smoking turkey legs without brine is a great way to enjoy the unique flavor of the bird without having to soak it in a brine prior to cooking. Smoking turkey legs is an easy process that only requires a few simple steps. In this article, we’ll discuss how to smoke turkey legs without brine, as well as some tips and tricks for achieving the perfect flavor. 

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

Before you begin smoking turkey legs without brine, you’ll need a few supplies. First, you’ll need a smoker. Electric smokers are the easiest to use, but you can also use a charcoal smoker or even a gas smoker. 

Next, you’ll need wood chips. Choose a wood that pairs well with turkey, such as apple, cherry, or hickory. You’ll also need a thermometer, preferably one that can be left in the turkey legs while they cook. Finally, you’ll need the turkey legs themselves. 

<h2>Preparing the Turkey Legs</h2>

Once you’ve gathered all of your supplies, it’s time to prepare the turkey legs. The first step is to remove any fat from the legs. This will help the turkey cook evenly and prevent flare-ups in the smoker. 

Next, you’ll want to season the turkey legs. Use your favorite seasoning blend or make your own. A simple combination of salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika is a great way to add flavor without overpowering the turkey. 

<h2>Smoking the Turkey Legs</h2>

Now that your turkey legs are prepared, it’s time to start smoking them. First, make sure your smoker is set up correctly and preheated to the desired temperature. We recommend smoking the turkey legs at 225-250 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Once the smoker is preheated, place the turkey legs in the smoker. Place a thermometer in one of the legs and close the lid. Let the turkey smoke for 2-3 hours, or until the internal temperature of the legs reaches 165 degrees Fahrenheit. 

<h2>Finishing the Turkey Legs</h2>

When the turkey legs have reached the desired temperature, it’s time to finish them. Carefully remove the legs from the smoker and place them on a baking sheet. Brush them with your favorite BBQ sauce, then place them under the broiler for 2-3 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly and beginning to caramelize. 

The finished turkey legs can be served immediately or stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
