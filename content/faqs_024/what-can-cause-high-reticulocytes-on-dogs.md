<p>Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells found in the bloodstream of dogs. They are usually a sign that the dog's body is producing new red blood cells. In some cases, however, a dog can have an abnormally high number of reticulocytes, which can be a sign of a serious underlying medical condition. In this article, we will discuss what can cause high reticulocytes in dogs, as well as the signs and symptoms to watch out for.</p>

<h2>What Are Reticulocytes?</h2>

<p>Reticulocytes are immature red blood cells that are produced by the bone marrow. They are released into the bloodstream before they are mature, and typically make up between 0.5 and 2 percent of the total red blood cell count. The presence of reticulocytes indicates that the dogâ€™s body is producing new red blood cells.</p>

<h2>What Can Cause High Reticulocytes in Dogs?</h2>

<p>There are several potential causes of high reticulocytes in dogs, including:</p>

<h3>Anemia</h3>

<p>Anemia is the most common cause of high reticulocytes in dogs. It occurs when the body is not able to produce enough red blood cells, which can be caused by a variety of factors, such as blood loss, chronic disease, or nutritional deficiencies. If a dog is diagnosed with anemia, the vet may prescribe iron supplements or vitamin B12 injections to help stimulate the production of red blood cells.</p>

<h3>Infection</h3>

<p>Infections can also cause high reticulocytes in dogs. Bacterial, viral, or fungal infections can all lead to the production of immature red blood cells. If a dog is suspected of having an infection, the vet will likely take a blood sample to determine if there are any abnormal numbers of reticulocytes present.</p>

<h3>Cancer</h3>

<p>Cancer can also cause high reticulocytes in dogs. In some cases, tumors can interfere with the production of red blood cells, leading to anemia and high reticulocytes. If your dog has been diagnosed with cancer, it is important to monitor their reticulocyte count and talk to your vet about the best treatment options.</p>

<h3>Medication</h3>

<p>Certain medications can also cause high reticulocytes in dogs. In particular, antibiotics can interfere with the production of red blood cells, leading to anemia and high reticulocytes. If your dog is taking antibiotics, it is important to monitor their reticulocyte count and talk to your vet about the potential side effects.</p>

<h2>Signs and Symptoms of High Reticulocytes in Dogs</h2>

<p>The most common signs and symptoms of high reticulocytes in dogs include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lethargy</li>
  <li>Loss of appetite</li>
  <li>Pale gums</li>
  <li>Weakness</li>
  <li>Swollen lymph nodes</li>
  <li>Difficulty breathing</li>
</ul>

<p>If your dog is showing any of these signs and symptoms, it is important to take them to the vet as soon as possible for an evaluation.</p>

<h2>Diagnosis and Treatment of High Reticulocytes in Dogs</h2>

<p>If your vet suspects that your dog has high reticulocytes, they will likely take a blood sample to confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the vet will determine the underlying cause of the high reticulocytes and recommend the appropriate treatment. Depending on the cause, treatment may involve antibiotics, iron supplements, vitamin B12 injections, or chemotherapy.</p>
