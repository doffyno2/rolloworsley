<p>The answer to the question of whether or not water bottle is a compound word is yes. A compound word is a combination of two or more words that together create a single word with a different meaning. Water bottle is an example of a compound word because it is the combination of two separate words, "water" and "bottle".</p>

<p>When looking at the definition of a compound word, it is important to understand that it does not necessarily have to include two words. It can also be made up of three or more words. For example, the compound word "sunscreen" is made up of three words: "sun", "screen", and "on".</p>

<p>Compound words can also be created by joining two words with a hyphen. For example, the compound word "ice-cream" can be created by joining the words "ice" and "cream" with a hyphen. This is an example of a hyphenated compound word.</p>

<p>Compound words can also be created by joining two words without a hyphen. For example, the compound word "sunshine" can be created by joining the words "sun" and "shine" without a hyphen. This is an example of a non-hyphenated compound word.</p>

<p>There are many different types of compound words and they can be formed in many different ways. Some examples of compound words are "sunscreen", "ice-cream", "sunshine", "water bottle", and "raincoat". All of these words are made up of two or more words that together form a single word with a different meaning.</p>
