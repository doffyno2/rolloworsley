<p>Are you looking to understand how to adjust the number of cycles per hour (CPH) on your Honeywell thermostat? If so, you’ve come to the right place. In this article, we’ll explain what CPH is and how to set it on your Honeywell thermostat. Let’s get started. </p>

<h2>What is CPH?</h2>

<p>Cycles per hour (CPH) is a measure of how often your thermostat cycles or turns on and off to maintain your desired temperature setting. The CPH setting on your Honeywell thermostat can be adjusted to reduce or increase the number of times your thermostat cycles per hour. </p>

<h2>Why Should I Adjust CPH?</h2>

<p>The CPH setting on your Honeywell thermostat should be adjusted if your home is feeling too hot or too cold. The higher the CPH setting, the more often your thermostat will turn on and off to maintain your desired temperature. This can cause your home to feel a bit too warm or too cold. Conversely, the lower the CPH setting, the less often your thermostat will turn on and off, which can cause your home to feel too hot or too cold. </p>

<h2>How to Adjust CPH on a Honeywell Thermostat</h2>

<p>Adjusting the CPH setting on a Honeywell thermostat is fairly easy. Here’s a step-by-step guide: </p>

<h3>Step 1: Locate the CPH Setting</h3>

<p>The first step is to locate the CPH setting. On most Honeywell thermostats, it can be found under the “System Setting” menu. On some models, it may be located under the “Schedule” menu. </p>

<h3>Step 2: Adjust the CPH Setting</h3>

<p>Once you’ve located the CPH setting, you can adjust it by pressing the “+” or “-” buttons. Higher CPH settings will cause your thermostat to cycle more frequently, and lower CPH settings will cause your thermostat to cycle less frequently. </p>

<h3>Step 3: Test the Setting</h3>

<p>Once you’ve adjusted the CPH setting, it’s important to test it to make sure it’s working properly. To test the setting, simply wait a few minutes and then check the temperature of your home. If the temperature is too hot or too cold, you may need to adjust the CPH setting again. </p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the optimal CPH setting?</h3>

<p>The optimal CPH setting will depend on your home’s size and climate. In general, it’s best to start with a CPH setting of 2 and then adjust as needed. </p>

<h3>Can I adjust the CPH setting manually?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can manually adjust the CPH setting on a Honeywell thermostat by pressing the “+” or “-” buttons. </p>

<h3>Does a higher CPH setting save energy?</h3>

<p>No, higher CPH settings generally do not save energy. In fact, higher CPH settings can cause your thermostat to cycle too frequently, which can lead to higher energy bills. </p>

<h3>What is the difference between CPH and CFM?</h3>

<p>CPH stands for cycles per hour and CFM stands for cubic feet per minute. CPH refers to how often your thermostat cycles on and off, while CFM refers to the speed at which air is moved through your HVAC system. </p>

<h3>What happens if I set the CPH too low?</h3>

<p>Setting the CPH too low can cause your home to become too hot or too cold. If you set the CPH too low, it’s important to adjust it as soon as possible. </p>

<h3>What happens if I set the CPH too high?</h3>

<p>Setting the CPH too high can cause your thermostat to cycle too frequently, which can lead to higher energy bills. If you set the CPH too high, it’s important to adjust it as soon as possible. </p>

<h3>Can I adjust the CPH setting on my phone?</h3>

<p>Yes, most Honeywell thermostats come with a mobile app that allows you to adjust the CPH setting from your phone. </p>

<h3>Can I adjust the CPH setting on my computer?</h3>

<p>Yes, you can adjust the CPH setting on your computer using the Honeywell Total Connect Comfort app. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Setting the cycles per hour (CPH) on a Honeywell thermostat is easy. Simply locate the CPH setting, adjust it using the “+” or “-” buttons, and then test the setting to make sure it’s working properly. </p>

<p>By following the steps outlined in this article, you’ll be able to adjust the CPH setting on your Honeywell thermostat with ease. </p>
