<p>When applying for a Citi credit card, it is important to know which credit bureau the company will use to check your credit. Different lenders may use different bureaus, and Citi is no exception. In this article, we will discuss which credit bureau Citi pulls from when considering credit card applications.</p>

<h2>What is a Credit Bureau?</h2>

<p>A credit bureau is a company that collects and stores financial information about consumers, including credit card and loan histories. This information is used by lenders to decide whether to approve loan applications. Credit bureaus obtain data from lenders, creditors, court records, and other sources. It is then compiled into reports that are used to assess the creditworthiness of potential customers.</p>

<h2>What is Citi?</h2>

<p>Citi is a large financial services company based in New York City. It provides a wide range of financial products and services, including credit cards, mortgages, personal loans, and investment services. Citi is one of the largest issuers of credit cards in the United States.</p>

<h2>Which Credit Bureau Does Citi Pull From?</h2>

<h2>Why Does Citi Pull From Different Bureaus?</h2>

<p>Citi pulls from different bureaus for several reasons. First, the data from each bureau may be different. For example, Experian may have information that TransUnion does not have, or vice versa. Second, it is possible that Citi may be trying to get a more complete picture of your creditworthiness. By pulling from multiple bureaus, Citi can get a better understanding of your financial situation.</p>

<h2>What Other Factors Does Citi Consider When Making a Credit Decision?</h2>

<p>In addition to the information in your credit report, Citi also considers other factors when making a credit decision. These include your income, employment history, and other financial information. Citi also considers the type of card you are applying for, as well as any other cards you may have with Citi.</p>

<h2>How Can I Check to See Which Credit Bureau Citi Pulled From?</h2>

<p>You can request a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major credit bureaus. This will show you which bureau Citi pulled from when it made its credit decision. You can also contact Citi directly to ask which bureau it pulled from.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Other Credit Card Issuers Who Pull From Different Bureaus?</h2>
