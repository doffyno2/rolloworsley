<h2>How to Apply for a TN Visa</h2>

Applying for a TN visa is a straightforward process. First, you must obtain an offer of employment from an appropriate employer in the United States. The employer must provide you with a TN visa application form, which you must complete and submit to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in your home country.
