<p>A ProForm treadmill is a great way to stay fit and healthy. However, for many people, the process of setting up and unfolding a ProForm treadmill can be confusing and intimidating. This article will provide a step-by-step guide to help you properly unfold your ProForm treadmill quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>Steps to Unfold Your ProForm Treadmill</h2>

<p>The next step is to grasp the handlebars and slowly pull them away from the machine. As you do this, the treadmill will begin to unfold. Be sure to keep a firm grip on the handlebars as the treadmill unfolds, as it can be heavy and unwieldy.</p>

<p>Once the ProForm treadmill is fully unfolded, the next step is to locate the power cord. The power cord is usually located at the back of the machine, and it is important to make sure it is plugged into a properly grounded outlet. If you do not have a properly grounded outlet, you can purchase an adapter at most hardware stores.</p>

<p>The final step is to locate the on/off switch. Most ProForm treadmills have an on/off switch located on the side or front of the machine. Once you have located the switch, flip it to the "on" position and you are ready to start your workout.</p>
