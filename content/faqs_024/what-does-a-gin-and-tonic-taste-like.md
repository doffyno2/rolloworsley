<p>Gin and tonic is a classic cocktail that has been enjoyed for generations. But what does it actually taste like? Well, the taste of a gin and tonic varies depending on which type of gin and tonic you’re drinking, as well as the brand and type of tonic you’re using. But generally speaking, a gin and tonic has a light, refreshing flavor with subtle botanical notes from the gin and a slightly sweet, bitter taste from the tonic.</p>

<h2>The Flavor of Gin</h2>

<p>Gin is a spirit made from juniper berries, which give it a distinctive, slightly woody flavor. Depending on the type of gin, it can also have botanical notes of citrus, herbs, spices, or even floral flavors. Gin is often referred to as a “dry” spirit, but many gins have a subtle sweetness to them that is balanced by the bitterness of the tonic water.</p>

<h2>The Flavor of Tonic Water</h2>

<p>Tonic water is a carbonated, sweetened beverage made with quinine, which gives it a slightly bitter taste. The sweetness of the tonic water balances out the bitterness of the quinine, making it a refreshing and enjoyable drink. Many brands of tonic water also add flavors such as citrus, herbs, or spices to create a unique flavor profile.</p>
