Bearded dragons, also known as Pogona, are a species of lizard native to parts of Australia. They're one of the most popular pet lizards, and they have a unique life cycle that's quite different from other lizards. In this article, we'll take a look at the whole life cycle of a bearded dragon, from egg to adult.

<h2>Egg Laying and Hatching</h2>
Female bearded dragons will lay a clutch of eggs in a shallow nest. The eggs are usually a white or tan color and are about the size of a ping pong ball. The eggs are incubated for about 60 days, after which they hatch.

<h2>Baby Bearded Dragons</h2>
Once the eggs hatch, the baby bearded dragons emerge. They're about two inches long and have a yellowish-orange color. They're able to move around and feed on their own right away. Baby bearded dragons are very active and curious and will explore their environment.

<h2>Juvenile Bearded Dragons</h2>
As the baby bearded dragons grow, they develop their adult coloration. Juvenile bearded dragons are usually darker in color, and may have stripes or spots. They also have longer, thicker tails and larger heads. Juvenile bearded dragons can grow up to 12 inches in length.

<h2>Adult Bearded Dragons</h2>
Adult bearded dragons reach their full size and coloration at around 18 months of age. They can grow up to 24 inches in length and can live for up to 15 years in captivity. Adult bearded dragons are usually a brownish-gray color, with darker stripes or spots.

<h2>Reproducing</h2>
Bearded dragons reach sexual maturity at around 18 months of age. When it's time to mate, the males will compete for the attention of the female. The male will then perform a courtship ritual and if the female is receptive, they will mate.

<h2>Egg Laying</h2>
Once the female has mated, she will lay her clutch of eggs in a shallow nest. She will then guard the eggs until they hatch. The eggs will incubate for about 60 days, after which they will hatch.
