Bicycling is a great way to get around, stay healthy and active, and enjoy the outdoors. But if you don’t take proper care of your bicycle, you can end up with a lot of problems. One of the most important maintenance tasks you will need to do is lubing your bike chain. But what happens if you don’t lube your bike chain?

<h2>Why Lube Your Bike Chain?</h2>

Your bike chain is under a great deal of pressure and tension, and it needs to be properly lubricated to keep it running smoothly. By lubing your bike chain, you can help reduce wear and tear on the components and extend the life of your bike. In addition, lubing your bike chain will help make your bike ride smoother and more enjoyable.

<h2>What Happens if You Don’t Lube Your Bike Chain?</h2>

If you don’t lube your bike chain, it can cause a number of problems. Without proper lubrication, the components of your bike chain can become dry and brittle, leading to cracks and breakage. This can result in a sudden failure of the chain and can cause serious injury. In addition, without proper lubrication, your bike chain can become noisy and difficult to pedal. 

<h2>How Often Should You Lube Your Bike Chain?</h2>

The amount of time between lubes depends on the amount of riding that you do, the type of conditions that you ride in, and the type of lubricant that you use. Generally, you should lube your bike chain every 100-150 miles or every two months, whichever comes first. If you ride in wet and muddy conditions, you may need to lube your chain more often. 

<h2>What Type of Lubricant Should You Use?</h2>

When it comes to lubing your bike chain, there are a variety of options available. You can use a dry lubricant, such as a wax-based lube, or a wet lubricant, such as a oil-based lube. You should choose a lubricant that is specifically designed for bicycle chains as other lubricants may not be as effective. 

<h2>How to Lube Your Bike Chain</h2>

Lubing your bike chain is a relatively simple task that can help keep your bike running smoothly and help extend the life of your components. To lube your bike chain, first make sure the chain is clean and free of dirt and debris. Then, apply the lubricant to the chain, making sure to get into all the nooks and crannies. Finally, use a rag to wipe off any excess lubricant. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Lubing your bike chain is an essential maintenance task that should be done regularly to help keep your bike running smoothly and help extend the life of your components. Failing to lube your bike chain can lead to problems such as dry and brittle components, noisy and difficult pedaling, and sudden chain failure.
