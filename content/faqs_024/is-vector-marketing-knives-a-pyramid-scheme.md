<h2>What is Vector Marketing?</h2>

Vector Marketing is a sales and marketing company that sells CUTCO knives, kitchen products, and other household items. The company was founded in 1981 and is based in Olean, New York. Vector Marketing is the exclusive distributor of Cutco products in the United States and Canada.

Vector Marketing uses a direct sales model, meaning that their salespeople are independent contractors who make money by selling products. Their salespeople are required to purchase their own sales kits, which include Cutco products, marketing materials, and other items.

<h2>What is a Pyramid Scheme?</h2>

A pyramid scheme is an illegal business model in which participants make money not by selling products, but by recruiting other people into the scheme. The people who join the scheme are promised a share of the money generated by the people they recruit. This type of scheme is illegal because it is unsustainable and participants are likely to lose money.

<h2>Is Vector Marketing a Pyramid Scheme?</h2>

Furthermore, Vector Marketing has been in business for nearly 40 years and has a strong customer base.

This indicates that the company is legitimate and not a pyramid scheme.

<h2>What Are Vector Marketing’s Practices?</h2>

Vector Marketing has been the subject of many accusations of unfair or unethical practices. The company has been accused of using deceptive sales tactics, such as making false promises or using high-pressure sales tactics.
