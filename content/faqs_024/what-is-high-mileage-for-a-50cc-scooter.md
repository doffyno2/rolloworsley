<p>Scooters are becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to cars for urban transportation. They are affordable, efficient, and have a very low environmental impact. One of the most common questions about scooters is how much mileage they get. For 50cc scooters specifically, the answer to this question depends on a few factors.</p>

<h2>What Is a 50cc Scooter?</h2>

<h2>What Factors Affect the Mileage of a 50cc Scooter?</h2>

<p>The mileage of a 50cc scooter is affected by a number of factors. These include the type of scooter, the weight of the rider, the terrain, and the amount of time spent idling.
