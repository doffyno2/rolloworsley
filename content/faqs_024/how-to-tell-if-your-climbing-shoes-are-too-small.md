<p>Climbing shoes are an essential part of your climbing gear, and having the right fit is essential for your performance. If your shoes are too small, you won’t be able to climb as well and may even put yourself in danger. Here, we’ll look at the signs of ill-fitting shoes and how to make sure your climbing shoes fit correctly.</p>

<h2>Signs Your Climbing Shoes Are Too Small</h2>

<p>The most obvious sign of too-small climbing shoes is discomfort or pain. If your feet are cramping up, feeling numb or tingling, or you’re getting blisters, then your shoes are definitely too small. Other signs of ill-fitting shoes include difficulty getting your feet in and out of the shoes, and difficulty with proper toe placement. If the toes of your climbing shoes are cramped, it’s a sign that they’re too small.</p>

<h2>What Size Should You Go For?</h2>

<p>When it comes to climbing shoes, it’s best to err on the side of caution and go for a size up from your usual size. Remember, climbing shoes are meant to fit snugly, not tightly. You should be able to wiggle your toes and should not be feeling any pain or discomfort. If your shoes feel too tight, it’s best to move up a size.</p>

<h2>How To Check The Fit Of Your Climbing Shoes</h2>

<p>The best way to check the fit of your climbing shoes is to try them on. You can do this at a store or at home. If you’re trying them on at home, make sure you wear the same socks you’ll be wearing while climbing. Once you have them on, stand up and walk around a bit to make sure they’re comfortable. Make sure your toes are not cramped and that there is no pain or discomfort. If you’re still unsure, you can always ask a professional to help you make sure your shoes fit correctly.</p>

<h2>Tips For Breaking In Your Climbing Shoes</h2>

<p>Climbing shoes can take a bit of time to properly break in. To make sure your shoes are comfortable, start by wearing them around the house for a few hours at a time. This will help them to form to your feet without you having to suffer through any discomfort. Once you’re comfortable wearing them around the house, try them out on a few climbs. If the fit is still good after a few climbs, then you can start wearing them on longer climbs. Eventually, the shoes will form to your feet and you’ll be able to go on longer, more difficult climbs with ease.</p>
