<h2>Introduction</h2>

Kids grow fast, and if you’ve ever found yourself in a situation where your child’s pants are too long, you know the struggle of trying to find a way to hem them temporarily. Luckily, there are several ways you can temporarily hem your child’s pants without having to take them to a tailor or spend a lot of money. In this article, we’ll show you how to temporarily hem kids' pants with some easy to follow steps. 

<h2>Tools You Will Need to Hem Kids' Pants</h2>

In order to temporarily hem kids' pants, you will need a few basic tools. These include:

<ul>
    <li>A pair of scissors</li>
    <li>A measuring tape</li>
    <li>An iron</li>
    <li>Safety pins</li>
    <li>A sewing machine (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Measure the Length of Your Child's Pants</h2>

Before you can begin hemming your child’s pants, you will need to measure the length of the pants. To do this, use a measuring tape and measure from the waist of the pants down to the bottom of the pants. Write down the measurements so that you can refer to it later. 

<h2>Step 2: Cut the Excess Fabric</h2>

Next, you will need to cut the excess fabric off of the bottom of the pants. Using the measurements that you took previously, mark where the hem should be with a fabric pen or chalk. Then, using a pair of scissors, cut off the excess fabric. Make sure that you cut straight and even lines. 

<h2>Step 3: Iron the Hem</h2>

Now that you have cut off the excess fabric, you will need to iron the hem. This is important because it will help to create a crisp and clean look. To do this, simply fold the fabric up towards the inside and press down with an iron. 

<h2>Step 4: Secure the Hem with Safety Pins or Sew</h2>

Once you have ironed the hem, you will need to secure it in place. You can do this by either using safety pins or by sewing. If you are using safety pins, simply insert the pins through the hem and into the fabric of the pants. If you are sewing, use a sewing machine to stitch the hem in place. 

<h2>Step 5: Trim the Excess Fabric</h2>

Finally, you will need to trim the excess fabric. Once you have secured the hem, you can use scissors to trim away any frayed threads or excess fabric. Make sure that you do not cut too close to the hem or it may unravel.
