<p>When you own a vehicle, it's important to keep up with regular maintenance to ensure that it runs optimally and lasts for a long time. For those who own a Mitsubishi Lancer, routine maintenance should be a priority, as it can help extend the life of the car and protect its value. But what exactly does routine maintenance on a Mitsubishi Lancer involve? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2>Oil Change</h2>

<p>One of the most important parts of routine maintenance on a Mitsubishi Lancer is having the oil changed regularly. Most manufacturers recommend that the oil be changed every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, depending on how you drive. The oil should be changed more frequently if you do a lot of stop and go driving or if you often drive in hot weather. Oil changes can help keep your engine running smoothly and can help prevent major engine damage.</p>

<h2>Fluid Level Check</h2>

<p>Another important part of routine maintenance on a Mitsubishi Lancer is checking the levels of all the fluids. This includes the engine oil, transmission fluid, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and coolant. All of these fluids should be checked regularly and topped off as needed. Low levels of any of these fluids can cause major problems with your vehicle.</p>

<h2>Tire Rotation & Alignment</h2>

<p>Getting your tires rotated and aligned should also be part of your routine maintenance on a Mitsubishi Lancer. Rotating the tires helps ensure that they wear evenly, while aligning them ensures that they are in the correct position. Both of these services can help you get the most out of your tires and can help extend their life.</p>

<h2>Brake and Battery Check</h2>

<p>Having your brakes checked is also an important part of routine maintenance on a Mitsubishi Lancer. It's important to check the brakes regularly to make sure they are functioning properly and that there are no issues that could cause a problem down the road. It's also important to check your battery periodically to make sure it is still in good condition and can hold a charge.</p>

<h2>Filters</h2>

<p>Another important part of routine maintenance on a Mitsubishi Lancer is changing the air, fuel, and cabin air filters. The air filter should be changed every 12,000 to 15,000 miles, while the fuel filter should be changed every 30,000 to 40,000 miles. The cabin air filter should be changed every 20,000 to 25,000 miles. Having clean filters can help your vehicle run more efficiently and can keep the air inside the car clean and free of debris.</p>

<h2>Belts and Hoses</h2>

<p>Finally, it's important to check the belts and hoses on your Mitsubishi Lancer during routine maintenance. Belts and hoses can wear out over time and can cause major problems if they are not replaced when necessary. It's important to check these parts regularly and replace them when needed to keep your vehicle running at its best.</p>
