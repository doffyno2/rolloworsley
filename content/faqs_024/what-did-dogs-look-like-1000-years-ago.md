<p>It is likely that the domestication of dogs first occurred around 14,000 to 17,000 years ago. Since then, dogs have changed and adapted over time to become the various breeds we know and love today. So, what did dogs look like 1000 years ago?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the specific breed of dog being discussed. However, some generalizations can be made. In general, 1000 years ago, dogs were much smaller than they are today. On average, they weighed around 30 to 40 pounds, with some breeds, such as the Chihuahua, weighing as little as 5 pounds. Additionally, dogs were much shorter than today’s average, with a height of around 16 inches.</p>

<p>1000 years ago, dogs were also much less varied in appearance than they are today. Most dogs were either short-haired or long-haired, with no in-between. In terms of color, white and black were the most common colors, with some breeds having a mix of both. Additionally, most dogs were not bred for specific traits, such as intelligence or athleticism, so their temperaments were not as predictable as they are today.</p>

<p>Sighthounds were the most common type of dog 1000 years ago. Sighthounds are a type of dog that is bred for its speed and agility, and they were used for hunting and herding. These dogs include the Greyhound, the Afghan Hound, and the Saluki. Other popular breeds at the time included the Pointer, the Bulldog, and the Sheepdog.</p>

<p>The arrival of the Age of Discovery during the 15th century led to the introduction of dogs from other parts of the world to Europe. This led to the creation of more diverse breeds, as well as the development of breeds that were specifically designed for certain tasks. For example, the Newfoundland was bred for water rescue, while the St. Bernard was bred for mountain rescue.</p>

<h2>How Has Dog Appearance Changed Over Time?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, dogs have changed and adapted over time to become the various breeds we know and love today. This evolution is largely due to selective breeding, which is the intentional breeding of certain traits in animals. Over time, this has resulted in a wide variety of different breeds, each with its own unique characteristics.</p>

<p>One of the most significant changes in dog appearance over time has been an increase in size. This is due to the fact that larger dogs were bred for specific tasks, such as hunting and protection. Additionally, the development of new breeds has led to an increase in variety in terms of coat color, texture, and length.</p>

<p>Another major change in dog appearance has been the development of specific traits, such as intelligence and athleticism. For example, retrievers were bred for their intelligence and retrieving ability, while sighthounds were bred for their speed and agility. This has led to an increase in the number of specialized breeds, each with its own unique characteristics.</p>
