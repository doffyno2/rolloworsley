The term “Second World” was used during the Cold War to refer to the countries that were part of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies. These countries, while not as powerful as the United States and its Western Bloc allies, were still considered to be more advanced than the Third World countries in terms of economic and political development. Although the term “Second World” is no longer in use, it is still important to understand which countries were part of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War in order to gain a better understanding of the world today.

The term “Second World” was first used during the Cold War to refer to the countries that were part of the Eastern Bloc, which was an alliance of communist countries that were aligned with the Soviet Union.
