<p>Have you ever experienced a sudden headache that came on after eating a high-carb meal? If so, you’re not alone. Many people report experiencing a “keto headache” after switching to the ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate meal plan. So, what does a keto headache feel like? In this article, we’ll discuss what causes a keto headache, how to prevent it, and how to treat it if you experience one.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Keto Headache?</h2>

<p>A keto headache is caused by a sudden change in carbohydrate intake. When you switch to the ketogenic diet, your body quickly begins to use fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. This process is known as ketosis, and it can cause a sudden drop in blood sugar levels, which can lead to a headache. </p>

<p>The ketogenic diet also causes a shift in the body’s electrolyte balance. This can lead to dehydration, which can also cause headaches. Because the keto diet eliminates many foods that are high in electrolytes, such as fruits and vegetables, it’s important to make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes from other sources. </p>

<h2>How to Prevent Keto Headaches</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent keto headaches is to make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes. This can be done by eating foods that are high in electrolytes, such as avocados, nuts, and seeds. You can also supplement with electrolytes, such as magnesium, potassium, and sodium. </p>

<p>In addition, it’s important to make sure you’re drinking enough water. Dehydration can also cause headaches, so make sure you’re drinking at least 8 glasses of water per day. </p>

<p>Finally, it’s important to make sure you’re getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can cause headaches, so make sure you’re getting at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.</p>

<h2>How to Treat a Keto Headache</h2>

<p>If you experience a keto headache, the best way to treat it is to make sure you’re getting enough electrolytes and water. You can also take ibuprofen or other over-the-counter pain relievers to help relieve the headache. </p>

<p>If the headache persists, it’s important to talk to your doctor. They may recommend medications or other treatments to help relieve the headache. </p>
