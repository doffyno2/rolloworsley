Time zones can be confusing, especially when we are trying to understand the meaning of certain acronyms. PDT stands for Pacific Daylight Time and is one of the time zones in North America. This article will explain what PDT means in time and how it affects our lives.

<h2>What Is Pacific Daylight Time (PDT)?</h2>
