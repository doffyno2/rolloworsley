<p>Ice cream is one of the most beloved treats in the world, and it comes in a variety of different flavors, ranging from classic vanilla to more unusual options like caramel peanut butter. But while ice cream can make a great treat, it can also be one of the most calorie-dense foods you eat. So what ice cream has the most calories?</p>

<h2>Calorie Counts of Popular Ice Creams</h2>

<p>Ice cream is a treat that can easily add up in calories. For instance, a single 1/2 cup serving of Ben & Jerry’s Half Baked ice cream contains a whopping 330 calories. This is far more than a single serving of even a full-fat ice cream like Breyers Natural Vanilla, which contains 140 calories per 1/2 cup.</p>

<p>Other popular ice cream brands can have high calorie counts as well. A 1/2 cup serving of Häagen-Dazs Chocolate Chocolate Chip contains 270 calories, while a 1/2 cup serving of Häagen-Dazs Vanilla contains 270 calories. Even a 1/2 cup serving of Edy’s Slow Churned Classic Vanilla contains 270 calories.</p>

<p>Overall, some of the ice creams with the highest calorie counts are those that are chocolate-based, such as Häagen-Dazs Chocolate Chocolate Chip, Edy’s Slow Churned Chocolate Fudge, and Ben & Jerry’s Chocolate Fudge Brownie. In general, chocolate-based ice creams tend to have more calories than other flavors. This is because chocolate-based ice creams contain cocoa, which is a calorie-dense ingredient.</p>

<h2>How to Cut Calories When Eating Ice Cream</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to cut calories when eating ice cream, then there are a few things you can do. First, try opting for a lower-calorie ice cream like Breyers Natural Vanilla, which has only 140 calories per 1/2 cup serving. Another option is to opt for a no-sugar-added ice cream, which can have significantly fewer calories than a regular ice cream.</p>

<p>You can also opt for a smaller serving size. For instance, a single 1/2 cup serving of Ben & Jerry’s Half Baked contains 330 calories, but if you only eat a 1/4 cup serving, then you’ll be consuming only 165 calories. Additionally, you can opt for lower-calorie toppings or mix-ins such as fresh fruit or nuts, rather than chocolate chips or candy pieces.</p>
