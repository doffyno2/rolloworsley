U-Haul trailers offer a convenient and cost-effective way to move large items from one place to another. But what can you fit in one? The answer depends on the size of the trailer, the items you need to move, and the way you pack them. In this article, we’ll explore the different sizes of U-Haul trailers, the types of items that can be moved in them, and the best way to pack them.

<h2>What Size U-Haul Trailer Do You Need?</h2>

The size of U-Haul trailer you need depends on the type and amount of items you need to move. U-Haul trailers come in three main sizes: 5x8, 6x12, and 7x14.
