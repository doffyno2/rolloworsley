<p>Wearing a pad with boyshorts is a great way to stay comfortable and secure while on your period. With the right fit, you can have a pad that won’t slip and slide, and boyshorts that won’t ride up and bunch. Here’s what you need to know to make sure you get the most out of your pad and boyshorts.</p>

<h2>Types of Pads</h2>

<p>When selecting a pad to wear with boyshorts, there are a few different types to choose from. Disposable pads are the most common type, and they come in a variety of sizes and absorbency levels. Cloth pads are another option, and they are reusable and often come in cute designs. Finally, period panties are a type of underwear that has a built-in pad and are designed to be worn with or without a separate pad.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Size</h2>

<h2>Secure the Pad</h2>

<p>Once you’ve found the right size pad, it’s important to make sure it’s secure. Most pads have adhesive strips on the back that will help keep the pad in place. If you’re using a cloth pad, you may need to use safety pins to secure it in place. You can also use a period panty liner, which will help keep the pad in place and absorb any extra blood.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Boyshorts</h2>

<p>When choosing boyshorts to wear with your pad, look for ones that fit snugly but aren’t too tight. Boyshorts should be made of a breathable fabric that won’t ride up or bunch. Look for boyshorts with a wide waistband and seams that won’t rub or irritate your skin. If you’re wearing a cloth pad, look for boyshorts with pockets that can hold the pad in place.</p>

<h2>Tips for Comfort and Confidence</h2>

<p>When wearing a pad with boyshorts, there are a few tips you can use to stay comfortable and confident. Wear underwear that fits properly, and make sure the pad is securely in place.
