Jorts jeans, also known as jean shorts or cutoff jeans, are a popular fashion option for the summer months when temperatures rise and the days get longer. They are the perfect way to stay cool and comfortable while still looking stylish. Jorts are a great alternative to regular jeans, offering the same level of coverage and comfort but with a much more relaxed and casual look.

The first jorts were created in the 1970s, when the popular look of bell-bottom jeans was replaced with a much more modern look. Jorts feature the same kind of fabric used for regular jeans, but they are cut much shorter, usually ending at the mid-thigh or just above the knee.
