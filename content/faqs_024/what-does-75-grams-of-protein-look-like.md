Protein is an essential macronutrient that plays a key role in many aspects of health, including building and maintaining muscle, regulating hormones, and keeping the immune system strong. For athletes and people who are trying to build muscle, getting enough protein is especially important. But how much protein do you need, and what does 75 grams of protein look like?

<h2>How Much Protein Should I Eat?</h2>

The amount of protein you need depends on your activity level, body composition, and health goals. The recommended daily allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.36 grams per pound of bodyweight, which is equivalent to 0.8 grams per kilogram.

<h2>How Much Protein Should I Eat for Muscle Building?</h2>

For muscle building, the RDA for protein increases to 0.45 to 0.68 grams per pound of bodyweight, or 1–1.5 grams per kilogram. For a 180-pound person, this translates to 81–126 grams of protein per day. This is a fairly wide range, so it’s best to experiment to see what works best for you.

<h2>What Does 75 Grams of Protein Look Like?</h2>
