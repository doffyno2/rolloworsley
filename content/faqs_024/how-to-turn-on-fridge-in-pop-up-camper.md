<p>For many campers, turning on the fridge in their pop up camper is one of the most important tasks before setting off on an adventure. The fridge is essential for keeping food fresh and drinks cold and can make or break an enjoyable camping trip. Thankfully, turning on the fridge in a pop up camper is a relatively simple process and can be done in just a few steps. In this article, we will explain how to turn on your fridge in a pop up camper.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check the Power Source</h2>

<p>The first step in turning on your fridge in a pop up camper is to check the power source. Pop up campers typically come equipped with two power sources; an electric hookup and a propane tank. If your pop up camper has an electric hookup, you will need to plug it in to the power source in order to turn on the fridge. If your pop up camper does not have an electric hookup, you will need to use a propane tank to power the fridge.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Connect the Propane Tank</h2>

<p>If you are using a propane tank to power your fridge in a pop up camper, you will need to connect the tank to the appliance. Begin by finding the propane connection on the fridge. This will be located near the back of the appliance. Connect the propane tank to the connection and make sure that the connection is tight and secure. Once the tank is connected, you will need to open the valve on the tank in order to allow the gas to flow into the fridge.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Turn on the Refrigerator</h2>

<p>Once the propane tank is connected and the valve is open, you can turn on the refrigerator. This is done by turning the dial on the front of the fridge to the “on” position. Once you have done this, the fridge will begin to cool down and you can start to store your food and drinks inside.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Monitor the Temperature</h2>

The ideal temperature for a pop up camper fridge is between 35 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If the temperature is not within this range, you should adjust the temperature dial on the front of the fridge. Additionally, you should check the temperature of the fridge regularly to make sure that it is working properly.</p>
