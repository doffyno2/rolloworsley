<p>Cauliflower ear is a distinctive physical abnormality that affects the ears of some dogs. This condition is characterized by an accumulation of fibrous tissue and cartilage in the ear flap and is typically caused by blunt trauma, such as being hit by another dog or a hard object. The most common symptom of cauliflower ear is a swollen and misshapen appearance of the ear, which can range from mild to severe. In some cases, the ear may also be painful or have a foul odor.</p>

<p>Cauliflower ear can also be caused by infection, such as a bacterial or fungal infection. If the infection is treated quickly, it may be possible to reverse the damage to the ear. However, if the infection is left untreated, it can lead to permanent damage and deformity of the ear.</p>

The ear may also be tender, painful, or have an unpleasant odor. In some cases, the ear may also be discolored or have an abnormal texture, such as a leathery or scaly appearance.</p>

<p>If you suspect that your dog has cauliflower ear, it is important to have him examined by a veterinarian as soon as possible.
