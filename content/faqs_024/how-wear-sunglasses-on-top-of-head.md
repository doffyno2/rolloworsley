<p>Wearing sunglasses on top of your head is a cool way to stay stylish and protect your eyes from the sun’s damaging rays. But how do you do it without it looking sloppy and falling off? Read on for the best tips and tricks for wearing sunglasses on top of your head. </p>

<h2>Choose the Right Sunglasses</h2>

<p>The type of sunglasses you choose will determine how well they stay on your head. Look for sunglasses that are lightweight and have a snug fit on your face. The frame should also have a wide enough bridge to stay in place when you tilt your head back. If you plan on wearing them on your head more often than not, you might want to consider investing in a pair of sunglasses specifically designed for this purpose.</p>

<h2>Adjust the Fit</h2>

<p>The best way to ensure your sunglasses stay put on top of your head is to adjust the fit. This can be done by loosening or tightening the temples. To loosen them, hold the frame in the center and gently pull the temples outward. To tighten them, hold the frame in the center and press the temples inward. If the fit is still not comfortable, you can take it to an optician who will be able to adjust the frame for you.</p>

<h2>Wear a Hat</h2>

<p>If you’re worried about your sunglasses falling off your head, wearing a hat can help. A hat with a wide brim will keep your sunglasses in place while also providing protection from the sun. Just make sure the brim isn’t too wide or else it might block your vision.</p>

<h2>Be Careful When You Bend Over</h2>

<p>When wearing your sunglasses on top of your head, be sure to be careful when you bend over. This is because the sudden downward motion can cause your sunglasses to slip off your head and onto the ground. To prevent this, be sure to keep your head in an upright position when bending over.</p>

<h2>Keep Your Hair Out of the Way</h2>

<p>Hair can often be the culprit of your sunglasses slipping off your head. To prevent this from happening, be sure to keep your hair out of the way when wearing your sunglasses. Pull your hair back into a ponytail or tuck it behind your ears to make sure it’s not blocking the sunglasses.</p>
