We can understand why people might be wondering the answer to this question. Many individuals, who are either 17 or have recently turned 17, will not remember the year they were born, while others are simply curious as to what year they were born. Whether you are looking to calculate your age or just curious as to what year you were born, this article will answer this question for you. 

<h2>Figuring Out What Year You Were Born</h2>

The answer to this question is actually quite simple. All you need to do is subtract 17 from the current year. For example, if the current year is 2020, then subtracting 17 from 2020 will give you the answer of 2003. This means that if you are 17 years old in 2020, then you were born in 2003. 

<h2>Other Ways to Calculate Your Age</h2>

If you are looking to calculate your age in a different way, there are a few other methods you can use. One way is to subtract the year you were born from the current year. For example, if you were born in 2003 and the current year is 2020, then subtracting 2003 from 2020 will give you an answer of 17. This means that you are currently 17 years old. 

Another way to calculate your age is to add up all the years from the year you were born until the current year. This can be a bit more complicated than the previous method, but it can still be done. For example, if you were born in 2003 and the current year is 2020, then you would add up the years from 2003 to 2020. This would give you a total of 17 years, meaning you are currently 17 years old.
