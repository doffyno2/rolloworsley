<p>When it comes to laundry, it is important to use a cycle that is suited for your clothes or fabric. Washing machines are designed to provide different kinds of cycles for different types of fabrics. One of the most important cycles is the gentle cycle, which is designed for delicate items like lingerie and baby clothes. But what exactly is a gentle cycle on a washing machine and why is it important? </p>

<h2>What is a Gentle Cycle? </h2>

<p>A gentle cycle on a washing machine is a cycle that is designed to be gentler on fabrics than other cycles. It uses a lower temperature, slower spinning, and fewer agitation cycles than other cycles, in order to reduce the wear-and-tear on fabrics. It is also designed to be less harsh on dyes and other delicate fabrics, so that they stay intact and vibrant. </p>

<h2>Why is a Gentle Cycle Important? </h2>
