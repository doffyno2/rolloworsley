<p>Using iTunes, you can easily select multiple songs at once. This can be especially useful for creating playlists, adding songs to a device, or simply deleting multiple tracks from your library. Here's how to do it:</p>

<h2>Selecting Multiple Tracks In iTunes</h2>

<p>Once you have iTunes open, navigate to the library where your music is stored. You can do this by clicking "Music" in the left-hand navigation bar. From there, you can browse your library by artist, album, genre, or any other sorting option. Once you've found the songs you want to select, simply click and hold the shift key on your keyboard and select the first and last tracks you want to select. All tracks in between will also be selected.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can hold down the command key on your keyboard and click on each track you want to select. This is especially helpful if you're selecting tracks from multiple albums, as it allows you to select all the tracks you need without having to switch albums.</p>
