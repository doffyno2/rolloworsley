<p>Julianne Hough is an Emmy Award-winning dancer, actress, singer, and entrepreneur from America. She is most well-known for her appearances in the musicals Grease and Footloose, and for her roles on the TV series Dancing with the Stars and Nashville. Hough is also an avid animal lover and has owned several dogs throughout her life.</p>

<p>In 2019, Hough's two beloved dogs, Lexi and Harley, were involved in a frightening incident. On the morning of January 6th, the dogs were out for a walk with their owner in the hills of Los Angeles when they were attacked by a mountain lion. The mountain lion injured both dogs, leaving Lexi with a broken leg and Harley with a deep gash in his neck.</p>

<p>Hough was able to get her dogs to safety and immediately sought medical attention for them. Both dogs were taken to an animal hospital where they underwent surgery to repair the damage caused by the mountain lion attack. After a long and difficult recovery, Lexi and Harley were eventually able to make a full recovery and are now back to their old selves.</p>

<p>The incident was a frightening experience for Hough and her dogs, but it was also a reminder of the dangers posed by wild animals in populated areas. While mountain lion attacks are rare, they can happen and it is important for people living in areas with a high concentration of wild animals to take the necessary precautions.</p>

<h2>What Are The Dangers Of Mountain Lion Attacks?</h2>

<p>Mountain lion attacks can be extremely dangerous, and in some cases, even fatal. Mountain lions are powerful predators and can easily overpower a small dog or even a human. In addition to causing serious physical injuries, mountain lion attacks can also cause psychological trauma as well.</p>

<p>Mountain lion attacks usually occur when a mountain lion is startled or feels threatened. If you come across a mountain lion in the wild, it's important to remain calm and avoid eye contact. Running away from a mountain lion can trigger an attack, so it's best to stay still and wait for the mountain lion to move on.</p>

<p>It is also important to keep dogs on a leash when walking in high-risk areas and to never leave a pet unattended in an area where mountain lions may be present. If you do encounter a mountain lion, it's best to back away slowly and make yourself as big as possible. Making loud noises and throwing things at the mountain lion can also help scare it away.</p>

<h2>What Other Precautions Can Be Taken To Avoid Mountain Lion Attacks?</h2>

<p>In addition to keeping pets on a leash and avoiding areas where mountain lions have been sighted, there are a few other steps that can be taken to reduce the chances of a mountain lion attack. For example, it's important to keep your yard free of debris and to avoid leaving pet food or garbage out in the open.</p>

<p>It's also a good idea to install motion-activated lights around your property to deter any potential mountain lions. If you live in an area where mountain lions are known to roam, it's also a good idea to check with your local wildlife department for any additional safety tips.</p>
