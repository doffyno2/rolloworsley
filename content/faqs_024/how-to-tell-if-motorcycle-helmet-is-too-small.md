<p>If you’re a motorcycle enthusiast, one of the most important pieces of safety equipment you can own is a helmet. Finding the right helmet is essential for protecting your head in the event of an accident. But how do you know if your helmet is too small? Read on to find out what signs to look for.</p>

<h2>Check the Fit</h2>

<p>The most obvious sign of a helmet that is too small is that it simply doesn’t fit your head properly. A helmet should fit snugly, but not be so tight that it causes discomfort or pain. It should also not move around on your head when you move it. If you feel a gap between the padding and your head, or if the helmet is too tight, it is too small.</p>

<h2>Look for Pressure Points</h2>

<p>Another sign of a helmet that is too small is the presence of pressure points. Pressure points are areas of your head where the helmet is pressing against your head too tightly. Some pressure is normal when wearing a helmet, but if it becomes uncomfortable or painful, then it’s a sign that the helmet is too small.</p>

<h2>Check the Weight</h2>

<p>The weight of your helmet is also an indicator of whether or not it fits correctly. If the helmet is too heavy, then it’s likely too big. On the other hand, if it feels too light, then it’s likely too small. The ideal weight of a helmet should feel evenly distributed across your head without feeling too heavy or too light.</p>

<h2>Look for Gaps</h2>

<p>The size of your helmet should also be taken into account when looking for a good fit. If the helmet is too small, it may not cover your entire head, leaving gaps between the helmet and your head. These gaps can be dangerous in the event of an accident, as they can leave your head vulnerable to injury. Make sure the helmet covers your entire head with no gaps.</p>

<h2>Tighten the Straps</h2>

<p>One of the most important things to do when testing the fit of a helmet is to make sure that the straps are properly tightened. If the straps are too loose, the helmet won’t fit properly and can move around on your head. On the other hand, if the straps are too tight, they can cause discomfort and pain. Adjust the straps until they feel snug but not too tight.</p>

<h2>Take It For a Test Ride</h2>

<p>The best way to check if a helmet fits correctly is to take it for a test ride. While wearing the helmet, go for a ride and get a feel for how it fits. If the helmet fits properly, it should stay in place and not move around on your head. If it does move around, then it is too small.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between a full face helmet and an open face helmet?</h3>
