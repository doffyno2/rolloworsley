Infants and babies grow so quickly that it can be hard to keep up with what size shoes they need. It’s important to make sure that your little one’s feet are always properly supported and comfortable, and this means finding the right size shoes for them. One of the most common sizes for infants is a size 4, so what age does this correspond to?

<h2>What Is a Size 4 Infant Shoe?</h2>

A size 4 infant shoe can also be referred to as a size 0, and it corresponds to an age range of 0 to 6 months. It’s important to note that this is an estimate and that individual babies will vary in terms of the size of their feet. Generally, if your baby is within the 0 to 6 month age range, they should be able to comfortably wear size 4 infant shoes.

<h2>Finding the Right Fit</h2>

It’s important to make sure that any shoes you buy for your baby are the right size and fit properly. A good way to check is to put your baby’s foot on a piece of paper and trace around it. Measure the length and width of the traced outline and compare these measurements to the sizing chart of the shoes you’re considering. This will give you a good indication as to whether the shoes will fit your baby’s feet.

<h2>When to Move Up to a Larger Size</h2>

When your baby’s feet have grown to the point where the size 4 infant shoes are no longer fitting them properly, it’s time to move up to the next size. Generally, this will be when your baby is between 6 and 12 months old. You can use the same method of tracing your baby’s feet and comparing to sizing charts to make sure you’re getting the right size.

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

When you’re buying shoes for your baby, there are a few other things to keep in mind. First and foremost, make sure that the shoes are comfortable and don’t cause any irritation or discomfort. Shoes that are too tight or too loose can cause problems with your baby’s feet.

It’s also important to make sure that the shoes provide enough support. Infant shoes should be flexible and supportive, and they should also be lightweight and breathable. This will ensure that your baby’s feet stay comfortable throughout the day.
