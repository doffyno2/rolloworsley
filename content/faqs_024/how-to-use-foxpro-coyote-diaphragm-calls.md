In this article, we’ll go over the basics of how to use a Foxpro coyote diaphragm call and what to do when the coyote is close by.</p>

<h2>What is a Foxpro Coyote Diaphragm Call?</h2>

<p>Foxpro diaphragm calls are a type of predator call that use a plastic or rubber diaphragm to create sounds. They are designed to mimic the sound of a coyote and can be used to lure them in from a distance. Foxpro diaphragm calls are designed to mimic the vocalizations of a coyote, including barks, howls, challenge barks, and pup distress screams. </p>

<h2>How to Use a Foxpro Coyote Diaphragm Call</h2>

<p>Using a Foxpro coyote diaphragm call is relatively easy. First, you need to make sure that your diaphragm is properly seated in your mouth. To do this, hold the diaphragm between your tongue and the roof of your mouth and blow air out through your nose. This should create a buzzing sound that is similar to a rattlesnake’s. </p>

<p>Once you have the diaphragm properly seated, you can begin using the call. You can start by making a distress call. This is done by taking a deep breath and blowing air through the diaphragm. You can also use a challenge bark, which is done by making a short, sharp bark through the diaphragm. You can also use a howl, which is done by blowing air through the diaphragm and making a long, low sound. To make a pup distress scream, take a deep breath and blow air through the diaphragm while making a high-pitched sound. </p>

<p>It is important to remember that when using a Foxpro coyote diaphragm call, you must use caution. Coyotes are wild animals and can be unpredictable. It is important to use the call from a safe distance and be aware of your surroundings. </p>

<h2>What to Do When the Coyote is Close By</h2>

<p>Once a coyote is close by, it is important to remain still and quiet. Do not move or make any noise that could startle the coyote. Make sure to keep your gun pointed in a safe direction and wait for the coyote to come into range. Once the coyote is in range, you can take your shot. </p>

<p>It is also important to remember that coyotes are very intelligent animals and can easily learn to recognize and avoid calls. If you find that the coyote is not responding to your calls, it is best to move to a different area and try again. </p>
