<p>It might sound like a joke, but it is a genuine question that some people are asking. The answer is actually quite interesting, and involves a bit of history and science. So what do you call a dog pile of cats?</p>

<h2>The Origins of the Term ‘Dog Pile’</h2>

<p>The term ‘dog pile’ has been around for some time. It is believed to have originated in the United States in the 19th century, when it was used to describe the actions of a group of dogs attacking a single animal. This led to the term being used to describe a group of people or animals all clambering over or around a single object.</p>

<p>The term was later applied to a group of people, usually children, all piling on top of one another in a playful manner. This became known as a ‘dog pile’, and is still a popular game among children today.</p>

<h2>Why Do Cats Form Cat Piles?</h2>
