<p>Recumbent bikes are a type of bicycle designed for people with disabilities and for those who may be unable to ride a regular bike due to physical limitations. They offer a more comfortable and stable ride, and typically have a lower center of gravity than a regular bike. Recumbent bikes are designed to provide a more comfortable and stable riding experience, which is especially important for amputees, who may have difficulty maintaining balance or stability on a regular bike.</p>
