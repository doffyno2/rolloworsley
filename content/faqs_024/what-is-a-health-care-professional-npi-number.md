<p>A Health Care Professional NPI Number is a unique 10-digit identifier assigned to physicians and health care providers, including hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, nursing homes, and home health agencies. It is used to identify providers in all health care transactions, such as claims processing, medical billing, and the exchange of electronic medical records. NPI numbers are also used to identify physicians in the National Provider Identifier (NPI) database, which is maintained by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).</p>

<p>The NPI number is the only identifier that is nationally recognized and is required for any health care professional to be able to participate in the Medicare program. It is also required for any provider who wishes to participate in Medicaid, or any other federal or state health care program. The NPI number is also used to identify providers in the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES).</p>

<p>The NPI number is assigned to health care providers who are subject to the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). HIPAA requires all health care providers to obtain and maintain an NPI number in order to participate in the Medicare program. All providers must also submit the NPI number to the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) or the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) in order to receive payment for services provided.</p>

<p>NPI numbers are assigned to health care providers by the National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES). The NPPES is a system managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS assigns the NPI number to each provider who is legally authorized to provide health care services in the United States. Once the NPI number is assigned, the provider must maintain it and use it on all Medicare and Medicaid claims.</p>

<h2>How Do I Obtain an NPI Number?</h2>

<p>The process of obtaining an NPI number is relatively simple. All health care providers who are eligible to participate in the Medicare program must register with the NPPES and obtain an NPI number. This process can be completed online at the NPPES website or via telephone.</p>

<p>When registering for an NPI number, the provider will need to provide a valid Social Security Number (SSN) or Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN). They will also need to provide contact information, such as their name, address, and phone number. The provider will also need to provide information on their specialty, as well as any other relevant information.</p>

<p>Once all of the information is submitted, the NPPES will verify the information and issue an NPI number. The provider will then be able to use the NPI number on all Medicare and Medicaid claims.</p>
