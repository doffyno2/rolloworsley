The Long Dark is a first-person survival game set in the Canadian wilderness. The game puts the player in a remote area of the Canadian Rockies with no trace of civilization, and tasks them with surviving the elements and the wildlife that inhabit the area.

One of the most important aspects of the game is managing your inventory and the items you have in your inventory. In order to do this, the game has an inventory system called "Carry Weight" which limits the amount of items you can carry at once. This article will look at ways to increase your carry weight and make sure that you always have the items you need to survive in the Long Dark.

<h2>What is Carry Weight and How Does it Work?</h2>

Carry Weight in the Long Dark is the amount of items you can carry in your inventory at any one time. This is a limited amount, and if you go over this amount, you won't be able to pick up any more items until you drop some of the items you are carrying. 

The amount of carry weight you have is determined by your character's stats. Your character's stats come from the clothing and equipment you are wearing, as well as any items you have in your inventory. The heavier the clothing and equipment you are wearing, the less carry weight you will have. 

<h2>How to Increase Carry Weight</h2>

There are several ways to increase your carry weight in the Long Dark. Here are some of the most effective methods:

<h3>Equip Heavy Clothing and Equipment</h3>

One of the easiest ways to increase your carry weight is to equip heavy clothing and equipment. Heavy clothing and equipment will add weight to your character, but will also increase your carry weight. Heavy clothing and equipment can be found in the game's clothing stores and is usually labeled with a "heavy" tag. It's important to note that equipping heavy clothing and equipment will also reduce your character's speed and agility, so it's important to weigh the pros and cons before equipping heavy items. 

<h3>Use an Animal Carrier</h3>

Another way to increase your carry weight is to use an animal carrier. Animal carriers allow you to carry more items in your inventory without the added weight of the items themselves. Animal carriers can be found in the game's Survival Stores, and can be filled with items such as food and tools. Animal carriers are also useful for storing food and items that you don't need immediately, so you can free up space in your inventory for other items. 

<h3>Craft a Backpack</h3>

Backpacks are one of the most useful items in the Long Dark, and can be crafted using materials found in the game. Backpacks can be used to carry additional items in your inventory without the added weight of the items themselves. Crafting a backpack also requires a certain level of skill, so it's important to practice your crafting skills before attempting to make a backpack. 

<h3>Carry Less Ammunition</h3>

Ammunition is one of the heaviest items in the Long Dark, and carrying too much can quickly reduce your carry weight. It's important to only carry the amount of ammunition that you need for the current situation, and to drop any extra ammunition when you don't need it. This will help to reduce your carry weight and make sure that you always have the items you need to survive in the Long Dark. 

<h3>Drop Unnecessary Items</h3>

It's also important to drop any items that you don't need in order to reduce your carry weight. This can be done by selecting the item and pressing the drop button. Dropping unnecessary items will free up space in your inventory, allowing you to carry more items without the added weight.
