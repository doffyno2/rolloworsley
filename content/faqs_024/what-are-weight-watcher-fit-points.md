<p>Weight Watchers is one of the most popular weight-loss programs in the world. It has been helping people lose weight for over 50 years and is still going strong.

For example, a light walk may earn you one Fit Point, while an intense spin class may earn you five Fit Points.</p>

<p>The idea behind Fit Points is to encourage people to stay active and get enough exercise each day. Weight Watchers believes that their members should aim to get at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, so the Fit Point system helps them reach that goal.
