<p>Curved blades are often used for cutting and slicing in the kitchen, whether you’re a professional chef or just a home cook. These blades are difficult to sharpen, however, and require a bit of extra attention compared to straight blades. Here’s how to sharpen curved blades, including kitchen knives and pocket knives, so they stay in top condition.</p>

<h2>Types of Curved Blades</h2>

<p>Curved blades come in many shapes and sizes. Kitchen knives are the most common curved blades; they have a curved edge that’s designed for slicing and dicing. Pocket knives are also curved blades, with a curved edge that’s typically used for cutting rope and other materials. Both types of curved blades require different sharpening techniques.</p>

<h2>Sharpening Kitchen Knives</h2>

<p>The best way to sharpen a kitchen knife is to use a whetstone. Start by wetting the whetstone and placing it on a flat surface. Place the knife on the whetstone with the blade pointing away from you. Begin by drawing the knife towards you in a sweeping motion, making sure to keep the blade flat against the stone. Repeat this process several times, then turn the knife over and do the same on the other side of the blade. When you’re done, rinse the blade and dry it off with a cloth.</p>

<h2>Sharpening Pocket Knives</h2>

<p>Sharpening a pocket knife is a bit more involved than sharpening a kitchen knife. Start by lubricating the blade with mineral oil. Place the blade in a vise and secure it in place. Begin by grinding the blade against a coarse stone at a 20-degree angle. Once you’ve sharpened the blade, switch to a medium stone and repeat the process. Finally, switch to a fine stone and repeat the process again. When you’re done, rinse and dry the blade.</p>

<h2>Other Sharpening Tips</h2>

<p>When sharpening any curved blade, it’s important to use the right technique. Make sure to hold the blade at a 20-degree angle and use long, sweeping strokes when sharpening. Don’t press too hard, as this can damage the blade. If you’re having trouble sharpening a curved blade, try using a honing steel to keep the edge sharp in between sharpenings.</p>
