<p>In Chinese, the number 4 is written as 四 (sì). This single character is read in two different tones, depending on the context. When it is used as an ordinal, it is read as sì (fourth), and when it is used as a cardinal, it is read as si (four). 四 is generally understood by Mandarin speakers, and is one of the few numerals that has a direct translation in Chinese. </p>

<h2>Etymology of 四</h2>

<p>The character 四 was first used in oracle bone script, a form of writing used during the Shang dynasty (1766BCE – 1122BCE).

<h2>Variations of 四</h2>

<p>In addition to its standard form, 四 can also be written in simplified form as 丨. This form is rarely used, however, and is generally only found in very old or archaic texts.
