<h2>What Is Snow?</h2>
Snow is a type of precipitation that occurs in winter months when temperatures drop below freezing. It is composed of ice crystals that form when water vapor in the atmosphere freezes. Snow can be light and fluffy or wet and heavy. Depending on its type and location, snow can be dangerous for dogs' paws and their overall health.

<h2>How Is Snow Dangerous for Dogs?</h2>
Snow can be dangerous for dogs for a variety of reasons. The most common danger is that snow can cause frostbite or hypothermia if the dog is exposed to cold temperatures for too long. Snow can also be hazardous due to the chemicals used to melt it. Deicing agents such as rock salt and calcium chloride can be toxic if ingested and can cause irritation on the skin or eyes if they come in contact with them.
