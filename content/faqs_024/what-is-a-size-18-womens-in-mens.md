<p>When shopping for clothing, it is important to know what size you are. However, this is even more important when shopping for clothing between different genders. For example, when shopping for clothing for women, you will need to know your dress size. But when shopping for clothing for men, you need to know both your dress size and your waist size. So, what is a size 18 women's in mens?</p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between Women's and Men's Sizing?</h2>

<p>When it comes to clothing sizes, there are two different systems: women's and men's sizing. Women's sizing is based on the woman's bust, waist, and hip measurements. Men's sizing is based on the waist size of the individual. This means that a size 18 women's is not the same as a size 18 men's.</p>

<h2>What is a Size 18 Women's in Mens?</h2>

<p>A size 18 women's is equivalent to a size 16 men's. This means that if you are a size 18 women's, you should look for a size 16 men's when shopping for clothing.

Once you have your waist measurement, you can use a conversion chart to determine your men's size.</p>
