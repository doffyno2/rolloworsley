Pine knots are small wood knots that form in pine trees as a result of irregular growth. These knots are usually found in the heartwood of pine trees and are most commonly found on the face of the tree. They are made up of dense, light-colored wood that has a deep reddish hue. Pine knots are formed when a tree's growth is stopped or slowed by an obstacle, such as a rock, another tree, or a disease. The tree will then form a knot in the shape of the obstacle, which can be seen on the face of the tree.

Pine knots have been used by humans for centuries as a source of firewood and lumber. They are also used in furniture making, and are often used in the construction of ships and other boats.
