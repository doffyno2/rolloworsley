<p>GPS ankle monitors are widely used by law enforcement agencies and courts to track the location of individuals who have been convicted of a crime. The ankle monitors work by sending a signal from the device to a monitoring agency that keeps track of the wearer’s location in real time. However, some individuals have managed to “trick” the GPS ankle monitor and avoid being tracked by the device.  </p>

<h2>What is a GPS Ankle Monitor?</h2>

<p>A GPS ankle monitor is a device that is attached to an individual’s ankle and is used by law enforcement to track the whereabouts of the wearer. The device works by sending a signal from the device to a monitoring agency that tracks the wearer’s location in real time. This type of device is used to monitor individuals who have been convicted of a crime and are on probation or parole, or those who have been placed under house arrest. </p>

<h2>How Does a GPS Ankle Monitor Work?</h2>

<p>A GPS ankle monitor works by receiving signals from a satellite to track the wearer’s movements. The device is attached to the wearer’s ankle and is monitored by a monitoring agency. The signals are sent to the monitoring agency, which then transmits the information to the law enforcement agency that is tracking the individual’s movements. The agency is then able to track the individual’s location in real time. </p>

<h2>How to Trick a GPS Ankle Monitor</h2>

<p>GPS ankle monitors are designed to be tamper-proof, but some individuals have managed to “trick” the device and avoid being tracked by the device. Below are some of the methods that have been used to trick a GPS ankle monitor. </p>

<h3>Using a Jammer</h3>

<p>The most commonly used method of tricking a GPS ankle monitor is to use a jammer. A jammer is a device that emits a signal that is strong enough to interfere with the signal sent from the ankle monitor to the monitoring agency. When the signal is interfered with, the monitoring agency is unable to track the wearer’s location. </p>

<h3>Removing the Device</h3>

<p>Another method of tricking a GPS ankle monitor is to simply remove the device. The device is attached to the wearer’s ankle with a strap and can be removed relatively easily. Once the device is removed, the monitoring agency is unable to track the wearer’s location. </p>

<h3>Using a Counterfeit Device</h3>

<p>It is also possible to trick a GPS ankle monitor by using a counterfeit device. A counterfeit device is a device that looks like a real GPS ankle monitor but does not have the same functionality. The device will still be able to receive the signal from the satellite, but it will not be able to transmit the signal to the monitoring agency. </p>
