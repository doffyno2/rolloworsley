<p>When a dog is in heat, it is normal for her to lick herself. This behavior is a way for her to clean herself and also to comfort herself. However, in some cases, it can be a sign of a more serious health condition. In this article, we’ll discuss why dogs lick themselves and what to look out for when a dog is in heat.</p>

<h2>Why Do Dogs Lick Themselves?</h2>

<p>Dogs lick themselves for a variety of reasons. Generally, it’s a way for them to clean and groom themselves. Additionally, licking can be a way for a dog to self-soothe or to show submission to other dogs or people. It's also possible that your dog may just be bored and looking for something to do.</p>

<p>In some cases, dogs may excessively lick themselves due to a medical condition. For example, if your dog has an infection or an allergy, they may lick or scratch themselves to try and relieve the itching. If you notice your dog excessively licking themselves, contact your veterinarian.</p>

<h2>What Should You Look for When a Dog is in Heat?</h2>

<p>When a female dog is in heat, she may lick herself more than usual. This is because she is trying to clean the extra blood and discharge associated with her cycle. It can also be a sign that your dog is uncomfortable or anxious during this time.</p>

<p>If you notice your dog licking herself excessively when she’s in heat, you should look for other signs that may indicate an underlying health problem. These can include swelling of the vulva, pain when urinating, and a vaginal discharge that is different from normal. If you notice any of these signs, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>What Other Signs Should You Look For?</h2>

<p>If you observe any of these signs, contact your veterinarian. They can examine your dog and determine if there is an underlying health issue that needs to be addressed.</p>

<h2>How Can You Help Your Dog While She is in Heat?</h2>

<p>When your dog is in heat, there are some steps you can take to help make her more comfortable. First, keep her away from male dogs. This will help reduce the chances of her getting pregnant. Second, provide her with a comfortable place to rest. If she has access to a soft bed or a blanket, she may be more likely to relax and feel more comfortable during her heat cycle.</p>
