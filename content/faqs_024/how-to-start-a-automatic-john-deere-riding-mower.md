<h2>Introduction</h2> 

Starting a John Deere riding mower can be a daunting task for first-timers. However, with the right steps and a little knowledge, you can have your mower started in no time. Here are our top tips on how to start a John Deere riding mower. 

<h2>Check the Gas Tank</h2> 

The first step in starting a John Deere riding mower is to check the gas tank. If the tank is empty, you'll need to fill it up with gasoline before you can start the mower. This is an important step, as the mower won't be able to start without fuel. 

<h2>Check the Oil Tank</h2> 

After making sure the gas tank is full, the next step is to check the oil tank. It's important to make sure the oil tank is full and has the correct oil level. This will help ensure the mower's engine runs smoothly and efficiently. 

<h2>Check the Battery</h2> 

Once the gas and oil tanks have been checked, the next step is to check the battery. This is an important step as well, as it will help ensure the mower starts quickly and efficiently. It's important to make sure the battery is fully charged and in good condition before attempting to start the mower. 

<h2>Set the Ignition</h2> 

The next step is to set the ignition. This is usually done by turning the key in the ignition. Make sure the key is turned to the "on" position and the mower is in neutral before attempting to start the mower. 

<h2>Turn the Key</h2> 

Once the ignition is set, the next step is to turn the key. This will begin the process of starting the mower. It's important to make sure the key is turned all the way to the "on" position and the mower is in neutral before attempting to start the mower. 

<h2>Pull the Starter Cord</h2> 

Once the key is turned, the next step is to pull the starter cord. This will begin the process of starting the mower. It's important to make sure the cord is pulled slowly and evenly to ensure the mower starts quickly and efficiently. 

<h2>Turn the Mower Off</h2> 

Once the mower is started, the next step is to turn the mower off. This will help ensure the mower runs smoothly and efficiently. To turn the mower off, simply turn the key back to the "off" position.
