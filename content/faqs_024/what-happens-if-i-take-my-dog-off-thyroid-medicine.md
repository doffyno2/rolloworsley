<p>Thyroid disease is common in dogs and can cause a range of serious health issues. Many pet owners turn to thyroid medicine to help manage their dog's condition. But what happens if you take your dog off thyroid medication?</p>

This article will explore what happens if you take your dog off thyroid medicine, as well as the risks and benefits involved.</p>

<h2>What is Thyroid Disease?</h2>

<p>Thyroid disease is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much or too little of the hormones that regulate metabolism and other bodily functions.

This can cause a range of symptoms, including weight gain, hair loss, lethargy, and increased appetite.</p>
