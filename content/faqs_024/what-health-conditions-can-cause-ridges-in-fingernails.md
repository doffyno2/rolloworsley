What Health Conditions Can Cause Ridges in Fingernails?


Nail health can be an indication of our overall health, and ridges in fingernails are often one of the first warning signs of underlying medical conditions. Ridges can range from mild to severe, and can make nails look unkempt and unhealthy. In this article, we'll look at the most common causes of ridges in fingernails and explain how to treat them.

<h2>What Are Fingernail Ridges?</h2>

Ridges in fingernails are horizontal or vertical grooves that run along the nail plate. They usually appear when the nail is not growing at a normal rate, which can be caused by a variety of factors. Ridges in fingernails can be mild or severe, and they can vary in terms of length and depth.

<h2>What Causes Ridges in Fingernails?</h2>

Ridges in fingernails can be caused by a wide range of medical conditions, including nutritional deficiencies, thyroid problems, and psoriasis. In some cases, ridges in fingernails are caused by trauma to the nail, such as cuts, scrapes, or even biting. Other common causes of ridges in fingernails include aging, over-exposure to water, and using harsh chemicals. 

<h2>Nutritional Deficiencies</h2>

Nutritional deficiencies are often the cause of ridges in fingernails, as the body needs adequate levels of vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy nails. Nutritional deficiencies can lead to weak, brittle nails that are more prone to ridging. Common nutritional deficiencies that can lead to ridges in fingernails include iron, vitamin B12, and zinc. 

<h2>Thyroid Problems</h2>

Thyroid problems can also cause ridges in fingernails. The thyroid is responsible for producing hormones that regulate metabolism, and when it is not functioning properly, it can affect nail growth. If the thyroid is overactive, it can cause the nails to grow too quickly, resulting in ridges. On the other hand, if the thyroid is underactive, it can cause the nails to grow too slowly, resulting in ridges. 

<h2>Psoriasis</h2>

Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that can cause a variety of skin symptoms, including ridges in fingernails. Psoriasis causes skin cells to grow too quickly, resulting in thick, scaly patches that can affect the nails. These patches can cause ridges in fingernails, as well as other nail abnormalities, such as pitting and discoloration. 

<h2>Trauma to the Nail</h2>

Trauma to the nail can also cause ridges in fingernails. This can include cuts, scrapes, or even biting the nails. Trauma to the nail can cause the nail to grow abnormally, resulting in ridges. 

<h2>Aging</h2>

As we age, our nails become more brittle and prone to ridging. This is because our nails become less elastic as we age, making them more susceptible to damage and ridging. 

<h2>Over-exposure to Water</h2>

Exposure to water, especially hot water, can also cause ridges in fingernails. Hot water can cause the nails to become dry and brittle, leading to ridges. 

<h2>Using Harsh Chemicals</h2>

Using harsh chemicals can also lead to ridges in fingernails. Harsh chemicals can strip the nails of their natural oils, causing them to become dry and brittle. 

<h2>How to Treat Ridges in Fingernails</h2>

The treatment for ridges in fingernails depends on the underlying cause. If the ridges are caused by a nutritional deficiency, then it is important to take a supplement or eat foods that are high in the nutrients that are lacking. If the ridges are caused by a thyroid problem, then it is important to talk to your doctor about thyroid medications. If the ridges are caused by psoriasis, then it is important to talk to your doctor about psoriasis medications. If the ridges are caused by trauma to the nail, then it is important to keep the nails clean and covered with a bandage until they have healed. If the ridges are caused by aging, then it is important to take care of the nails by keeping them moisturized and avoiding harsh chemicals. If the ridges are caused by over-exposure to water, then it is important to wear gloves when washing dishes or taking baths.
