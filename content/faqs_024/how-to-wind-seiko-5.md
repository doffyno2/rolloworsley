<h2>What Is an Automatic Watch?</h2>

<p>An automatic watch is a type of mechanical watch that uses a mainspring as its power source. The mainspring is wound by the natural motion of the wearer’s arm, and this motion powers the watch. As long as you wear the watch and move around, the watch will stay wound and keep accurate time.

<h2>How to Wind a Seiko 5</h2>

To wind the watch, simply turn the crown clockwise until it stops. This will wind the mainspring and get the watch ticking. Be sure not to wind the crown too much, as this can damage the watch.</p>

<p>Once you’ve manually wound the watch, you don’t need to wind it again unless it stops running. As long as you wear the watch, the natural motion of your arm will keep it wound and ticking.

<h2>How Often Should I Wind My Seiko 5?</h2>

<p>As long as you wear the watch and move around, the watch will stay wound and keep accurate time. If you don’t wear the watch for a few days, you may need to wind it again. To do this, simply turn the crown clockwise until it stops.</p>
