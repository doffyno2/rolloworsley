<p>The Jeep Grand Cherokee is one of the most popular SUVs on the market today, and for good reason. It's a rugged, reliable vehicle that can take you anywhere you need to go, from the grocery store to the off-road trails. But, no matter how rugged your Jeep is, it won't be able to tackle the toughest terrain without the right tires. So, what are the biggest tires for a stock Jeep Grand Cherokee? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2>The Basics of Tire Sizing</h2>

<p>When it comes to tires, size is an important factor. Tires come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 15-inch to 22-inch. The size of the tire is determined by the width, height and rim diameter. The width is measured in millimeters, and the height is measured in percentages of the width. The rim diameter is measured in inches. When you're shopping for tires for your Jeep, you'll want to make sure you get the right size for your vehicle. If your Jeep came with stock tires, you can usually find the size printed on the sidewall of the tire.</p>

<h2>What Are the Biggest Tires for a Stock Jeep Grand Cherokee?</h2>

<p>The biggest tires that can be installed on a stock Jeep Grand Cherokee are 20-inch tires. This is based on the stock suspension and wheel size, which is 17 inches. If you're looking to upgrade your Jeep with larger tires, you'll need to make some modifications to the suspension and wheel size to accommodate bigger tires. If you're looking for the biggest tires that are compatible with the stock suspension, 20 inches is the way to go.</p>

<h2>What Type of Tires Should I Choose?</h2>

<p>Once you've determined the size of tire that you need, the next step is to decide what type of tire you want. Some of the most popular types of tires for Jeeps are all-terrain tires, mud-terrain tires, and winter tires. All-terrain tires are designed for a variety of surfaces and are a great choice for off-roading. Mud-terrain tires are designed for even more extreme off-roading and are better suited for muddy or rocky terrain. Winter tires are designed for icy and snowy conditions and offer better traction in cold weather.</p>

<h2>Are Bigger Tires Better?</h2>

<p>The simple answer is yes, bigger tires are typically better. Larger tires provide more ground clearance, which means you can tackle tougher terrain. They also provide better traction, which is important when you're off-roading. However, there are some drawbacks to larger tires. For example, they can be more expensive and they can reduce gas mileage due to increased rolling resistance.</p>

<h2>Are Bigger Tires Harder to Install?</h2>

<p>Installing bigger tires on your Jeep is not necessarily more difficult than installing smaller tires. However, it is important to note that bigger tires may require modifications to the suspension and wheel size in order to accommodate them. If you're not comfortable making these modifications yourself, it's best to hire a professional to do the job. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the tires you choose are compatible with the suspension and wheel size of your Jeep.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Bigger Tires?</h2>

<p>Bigger tires offer several benefits, including increased ground clearance, better traction, and improved stability. The extra ground clearance is useful for tackling tougher terrain, and the better traction is great for off-roading. The improved stability is also beneficial, as it helps to keep your Jeep stable on uneven terrain. Additionally, bigger tires can give your Jeep a more aggressive look.</p>
