<p>Hockey socks are an essential piece of hockey gear. They provide cushioning and protection from abrasions and cuts, as well as a layer of warmth in cold weather. Properly fitting hockey socks are crucial for the performance of the player. In this article, we will discuss the different types of hockey socks and how to wear them correctly.</p>

<h2>Types of Hockey Socks</h2>

<p>There are two main types of hockey socks: traditional hockey socks and compression hockey socks. Traditional hockey socks are made from a thick, heavy cotton and are designed to be worn over hockey pants. They are usually available in different lengths, from ankle-length to knee-length, and typically feature a lace-up closure. Compression hockey socks are made from a lighter, stretchier material and are designed to be worn under hockey pants. They provide more support and stability to the leg muscles, as well as a tighter fit to reduce bunching and sliding.</p>

<h2>How to Wear Traditional Hockey Socks</h2>

<p>When wearing traditional hockey socks, it is important to make sure that they fit properly. The lace-up closure should be snug enough to stay up, but not so tight that it restricts movement. Make sure that the length of the sock is appropriate for your height. If the socks are too short, they will not provide adequate cushioning or protection. If the socks are too long, they may bunch up and slide down during a game.</p>

<p>When putting on traditional hockey socks, start at the bottom and work your way up. Pull the sock up to your knee and then secure the laces tight. Make sure that the laces are not too tight or too loose. Once the laces are secure, make sure that the sock is snug against your foot and calf. If it feels too loose or bunched up, adjust the laces until you have a comfortable fit.</p>

<h2>How to Wear Compression Hockey Socks</h2>

<p>Compression hockey socks are designed to be worn under the hockey pants. Start by pulling the sock up to your knee and then make sure that it is snug against your foot and calf. If the sock is too loose or bunched up, adjust it until you have a comfortable fit. Make sure to wear the correct size sock so that it does not become too tight or restrict movement.</p>

<p>Compression hockey socks should also fit snugly against the shin guard for added protection. Make sure that the sock is long enough to cover the shin guard completely, and that it does not bunch up or slide down during a game.</p>

<h2>Caring for Hockey Socks</h2>

<p>Hockey socks should be washed after every use. Wash them in cold water with a mild detergent, and air dry them away from direct sunlight. Do not put them in the dryer, as this can damage the material and cause them to shrink. Also, avoid using fabric softener or bleach, as these can also damage the material.</p>
