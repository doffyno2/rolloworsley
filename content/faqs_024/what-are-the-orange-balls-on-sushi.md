Sushi is one of the most popular Japanese dishes worldwide. It’s often found on the menu at any Japanese restaurant and is a favorite amongst many. But have you ever wondered what those orange balls on top of the sushi are? You’re not the only one. In this article, we’ll explain what the orange balls are, why they are used, and how to enjoy them.

<h2>What Are The Orange Balls On Sushi?</h2>

The orange balls on top of sushi are called ikura, and they are actually roe, or fish eggs. Ikura is a type of salmon roe, which is the eggs of the salmon fish. The orange-red hue of the roe is due to a high concentration of carotenoids, which gives them their vibrant color. The eggs themselves are salted and cured, and then placed on top of the sushi.

When eating sushi with ikura, it’s important to remember that it can be quite salty. Thus, it’s best to enjoy it with some soy sauce and wasabi. The soy sauce brings out the flavor of the ikura, while the wasabi helps to balance out the saltiness. It’s also important to note that ikura should not be eaten alone, as it can be quite difficult to swallow.

<h2>The Benefits Of Eating Ikura</h2>

Ikura is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for a healthy diet. They are also high in protein and vitamin A, making them a great source of nutrition. Therefore, eating ikura is a great way to get the vitamins and minerals that your body needs.

<h2>Where To Find Ikura</h2>

Ikura is available at most Japanese supermarkets and some specialty stores. It can also be purchased online, making it easy to find. However, it’s important to note that ikura is usually sold in small packages and can be quite expensive.
