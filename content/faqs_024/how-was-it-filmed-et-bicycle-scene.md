<p>The bicycle scene from the classic movie <i>ET the Extra Terrestrial</i> is one of the most iconic and beloved moments in the history of film. But have you ever wondered how it was filmed? The bicycle scene was the result of a carefully planned and executed sequence that relied on a combination of creative techniques, stunt work, and visual effects. In this article, we'll take a closer look at how the iconic scene was filmed and the techniques and technologies used to make it happen.</p>

<h2>The Bicycle Scene</h2>

<p>The bicycle scene in ET is one of the most memorable moments of the movie. The scene starts with a close-up of ET's face as he looks up in awe at the full moon. As the camera zooms out, we see a group of children aboard a makeshift bicycle contraption, with ET on a seat in the front. As the children ride around the neighborhood in the night, the bicycle lifts off the ground and is propelled forward by a mysterious force. It's a magical moment that has become an icon of the film.</p>

<h2>The Stunt Work</h2>

<p>The bicycle scene was created through a combination of stunt work and visual effects. The stunt work involved the use of a wire-rigged bicycle contraption that was suspended from a crane. This allowed for the bicycle to be raised off the ground and rotated in different directions, creating the effect of flight. The wire-rigged bicycle was then replaced with a CGI version in post-production.</p> 

<h2>The Visual Effects</h2>

<p>The visual effects used to create the bicycle scene were fairly simple but effective. The camera was placed at a low angle to give the illusion of a moon-lit night. The bicycle was then filmed against a blue screen and composited with a matte painting of a neighborhood. The matte painting was used to create the illusion of a full moon in the night sky. In addition, the bicycle was enhanced with smoke and light effects to create the illusion of flight.</p>

<h2>The Legacy of the Bicycle Scene</h2>

<p>The bicycle scene from ET has become an iconic moment in film history, and is often cited as an example of how visual effects can be used to create a believable, emotionally powerful scene. In addition, the scene has become an inspiration for filmmakers, who often use similar techniques to create their own effects. The bicycle scene from ET is a testament to the power of visual effects and the creativity of filmmakers.</p>
