<h2>What Are Baseballs Made of?</h2>

Baseballs are made up of several layers of materials, including a cork center, rubber core, and a leather, or synthetic, outer shell. The cork center is made up of small pieces of cork that are compressed together and held in place with a rubber adhesive.

The leather or synthetic material is typically dyed red, white, or blue and is sewn together to form the outer shell.

The leather or synthetic material that makes up the outer shell of the baseball can be chewed up and swallowed, which can lead to intestinal blockage and other health issues.
