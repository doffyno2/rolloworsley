<p>Before you decide to pursue a career in medicine, it is important to consider the benefits of a public health education. Public health is a field of study that focuses on the health of a population, rather than the health of an individual. It is a broad, interdisciplinary field that covers a variety of topics, ranging from preventive medicine and health promotion to nutrition, epidemiology, and environmental health. By studying public health, you can gain a better understanding of the factors that influence health, such as environmental, social, economic, and political factors. This knowledge can help you make more informed decisions when it comes to your own health and the health of those around you.</p>

<p>For pre-med students, a public health education can be invaluable. A public health education can provide you with the skills and knowledge you need to understand the complexities of health and health care. It can also help you develop an understanding of the social determinants of health and how they influence health outcomes. This knowledge can be beneficial when you are considering medical school and working in the medical profession. Additionally, a public health education can provide you with a broader perspective on the health of your patients, which can be a valuable asset when it comes to providing quality care.</p>
