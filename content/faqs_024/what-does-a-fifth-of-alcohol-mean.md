<p>When it comes to drinking alcohol, there are a few different terms that are often used to describe the amount of alcohol a person is consuming. One such term is “a fifth” – but what does a fifth of alcohol mean?</p>

<p>In the United States, a fifth is a common measurement for spirits, such as whiskey and vodka. A fifth is equal to one-fifth of a gallon, or 25.6 fluid ounces. In other words, a fifth is the equivalent of 750ml – or just over a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>In the UK, a fifth is also referred to as a “bottle”. This measurement is slightly different than in the US, as a UK bottle of whiskey or vodka is equal to 28.4 fluid ounces – or just over 830ml.</p>

<p>It is important to note that a fifth is not the same as a “pint”, which is a measurement used to describe beer. A pint is equal to 16 fluid ounces, or 473ml.</p>

<h2>How Much Alcohol is in a Fifth?</h2>

<p>A fifth of alcohol contains approximately 17 standard drinks, which are equivalent to 17 shots of a spirit. In the US, a standard drink is equal to 0.6 fluid ounces (or 1.5 teaspoons) of pure alcohol. In the UK, a standard drink is equal to 1.2 fluid ounces (or 3 teaspoons).</p>

<p>It is important to note that the amount of alcohol in a fifth can vary depending on the type of alcohol. For example, some types of beer contain more alcohol than others, while wine can range anywhere from 5% to 20% ABV (alcohol by volume).</p>

<h2>How Many Drinks Can You Have in a Fifth?</h2>

<p>The number of drinks you can have in a fifth of alcohol depends on the amount of alcohol in the drink. Generally speaking, a fifth of a spirit (whiskey, vodka, etc.) contains approximately 17 standard drinks, while a fifth of wine or beer may contain fewer drinks.</p>

<p>It is important to note that it is not recommended that you consume all 17 drinks in one sitting. Drinking too much alcohol can lead to potential health risks, such as alcohol poisoning and other serious medical conditions.</p>

<h2>What is a Pony?</h2>

<p>The term “pony” is commonly used to describe a small amount of alcohol. A pony is equal to one-eighth of a gallon, or 12.8 fluid ounces. In other words, a pony is the equivalent of 375ml – or just over half a bottle of wine.</p>
