What is a Mental Health Warrant in PA?


Mental health warrants are a type of court order issued in Pennsylvania that allow law enforcement to take a person into custody due to a mental health crisis. These warrants are issued by magisterial district judges (MDJ) and are often referred to as “involuntary commitment orders.”

The purpose of a mental health warrant is to provide a safe and secure environment for an individual in need of mental health care. It is important to note that a mental health warrant is not the same as an arrest warrant. A mental health warrant is issued by a judge, who has determined that the individual is in need of treatment for a mental health disorder and is a danger to themselves or others.

<h2>Who Can Request a Mental Health Warrant?</h2>

A mental health warrant can be requested by law enforcement personnel, a physician, or a mental health professional. In order for the request to be granted, the individual must meet certain criteria. The criteria include:

- The individual must be experiencing a mental health crisis.
- The individual must be a danger to themselves or others.
- The individual must be unable or unwilling to voluntarily seek treatment.

<h2>What Happens After a Mental Health Warrant is Issued?</h2>

Once a mental health warrant is issued, law enforcement officers will take the person into custody and transport them to a hospital. At the hospital, the individual will be evaluated by a mental health professional and a treatment plan will be created. The individual may be admitted to the hospital or released to their family or other responsible party.

<h2>What Rights Does the Person Have During the Process?</h2>

The individual has the right to be informed of their rights, including the right to refuse treatment and the right to an attorney. If a person is admitted to a hospital, they also have the right to appeal the decision. If the individual is released to their family or another responsible party, they have the right to refuse treatment and the right to an attorney, as well.

<h2>What is the Difference Between a Mental Health Warrant and an Arrest Warrant?</h2>

An arrest warrant is issued when a person is suspected of committing a crime. A mental health warrant is issued when a person is in need of mental health care and is a danger to themselves or others. An arrest warrant is issued by a law enforcement agency, while a mental health warrant is issued by a magisterial district judge.
