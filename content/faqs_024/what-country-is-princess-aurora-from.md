<p>Princess Aurora, also known as Sleeping Beauty or Briar Rose, is one of the most beloved Disney princesses of all time. She is the daughter of King Stefan and Queen Leah, and is the protagonist of the 1959 classic film Sleeping Beauty. But what country is the princess from?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is a bit complicated. In the original fairy tale, which the movie is based on, Princess Aurora is from a fictional kingdom simply referred to as the Kingdom of the Sun. This kingdom is not based on any real-world country, and is instead a completely fictional kingdom. </p>

<p>However, in the Disney version of the story, the kingdom is situated in a vaguely European-style setting. This is consistent with other Disney films, such as Cinderella and Snow White, which also feature European-style kingdoms. It is likely that the filmmakers chose this setting in order to make the story more relatable to their audience, which is mostly made up of viewers from Europe and North America. </p>

<p>The kingdom itself is never explicitly named in the movie, but there are several clues that can help us narrow down the location. For example, the castle is surrounded by a forest, suggesting that it is located in a temperate climate. Additionally, the kingdom is surrounded by mountains, suggesting that it is located in an area with a mountainous landscape. Finally, the kingdom appears to be quite advanced, with a thriving economy and advanced infrastructure. All of these clues point to a location in Central Europe, such as Switzerland or Austria. </p>

<p>So, while the exact location of Princess Aurora's kingdom is never revealed in the movie, it is likely that it is located somewhere in Central Europe. This makes sense, given the setting of the movie and the clues that are provided by the filmmakers. </p>
