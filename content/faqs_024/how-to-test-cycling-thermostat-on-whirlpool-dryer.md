<p>If you want to test cycling thermostat on Whirlpool Dryer, you should know the basics of how it works. The cycling thermostat is an important part of the dryer, as it helps to regulate the temperature and ensure that it does not get too hot or too cold. It is also responsible for turning the dryer off when it reaches the desired temperature. </p>

<h2>What is a Cycling Thermostat?</h2>

<p>A cycling thermostat is a device that is located on the inside of your dryer and is used to regulate the temperature. It is made up of two parts: a thermostat and a contactor. The thermostat is responsible for sensing the temperature of the air inside the dryer, while the contactor is responsible for controlling the current flow to the heating element. </p>

<h2>How Does a Cycling Thermostat Work?</h2>

<p>A cycling thermostat works by sensing the temperature inside the dryer and then turning the heating element on or off accordingly. When the temperature inside the dryer reaches a certain level, the cycling thermostat will turn the heating element off. The thermostat also ensures that the temperature does not get too hot or too cold. When the desired temperature is reached, the thermostat will turn the heating element off and the dryer will stop running. </p>

<h2>How to Test Cycling Thermostat on Whirlpool Dryer?</h2>

<p>Testing your cycling thermostat on your Whirlpool Dryer is easy. First, make sure that you have the correct tools to do the job. You will need a multimeter, a screwdriver, and a small Phillips head screwdriver. </p>

<h3>Step 1: Locate the Cycling Thermostat</h3>

<p>The first step to testing your cycling thermostat on your Whirlpool Dryer is to locate it. The cycling thermostat is located on the lower left side of the dryer, just above the lint filter. It is a small metal box with two screws. Once you have located the cycling thermostat, you can begin the testing process. </p>

<h3>Step 2: Disconnect the Wires</h3>

<p>The next step to testing your cycling thermostat on your Whirlpool Dryer is to disconnect the wires from the thermostat. Use a small Phillips head screwdriver to loosen the two screws that hold the wires in place. Then, gently pull the wires off of the thermostat. Be sure to keep track of which wire goes where, as this will be important during the testing process.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Test the Cycling Thermostat</h3>

<p>Once you have disconnected the wires from the cycling thermostat, you can now test it. To do this, you will need a multimeter. Set the multimeter to the appropriate setting and touch the two leads to the two terminals on the cycling thermostat. If the multimeter reads the correct voltage, then the cycling thermostat is working properly. If not, then you will need to replace the cycling thermostat. </p>
