The pain in your shoulders when you sneeze can be a real nuisance. It’s a common complaint, and it can range from a mild discomfort to outright agony. Fortunately, understanding what causes it and what you can do about it can help to ease the pain you feel.

<h2>What Causes Shoulder Pain When Sneezing? </h2>

The pain you experience when you sneeze is caused by a sudden increase in abdominal pressure. This pressure can cause the muscles and ligaments in your chest and shoulder area to become strained, leading to pain in the area.

<h2>What Else Could Be Causing Shoulder Pain? </h2>

It’s important to remember that shoulder pain when sneezing isn’t always caused by the same thing. Some of the other potential causes of shoulder pain include:

<h3>Injury or trauma</h3>

Injuries such as fractures, dislocations, and sprains can cause pain in the shoulder area. This can be caused by a sudden impact, such as in a car accident, or overuse, such as when playing sports.

<h3>Arthritis</h3>

Arthritis, which is an inflammation of the joints, can cause pain and stiffness in the shoulder area. This pain can be worse when you move the joint, and it can become worse over time if it’s not treated.

<h3>Tendonitis</h3>

Tendonitis is an inflammation of the tendons that connect muscles and bones. It can cause pain and stiffness in the shoulder area, and it can be aggravated by activities that involve repetitive motions.

<h3>Frozen Shoulder</h3>

Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is a condition that causes the shoulder joint to become inflamed and stiff. It can cause pain and limited range of motion, and it can take a long time to resolve.

<h3>Rotator Cuff Injury</h3>

The rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that help to stabilize and move the shoulder joint. When these muscles and tendons become injured, it can cause pain and limited range of motion in the shoulder.

<h2>How Can I Treat Shoulder Pain When Sneezing? </h2>

Treating shoulder pain when sneezing depends on what’s causing the pain. If the pain is caused by an injury or trauma, then rest and ice can help to reduce inflammation and pain. If the pain is caused by arthritis or tendonitis, then anti-inflammatory medications can help to reduce pain and stiffness.

If the pain is caused by a rotator cuff injury, then physical therapy can help to strengthen the muscles and tendons and reduce pain. If the pain is caused by frozen shoulder, then physical therapy and medications can help to reduce the inflammation and stiffness.

<h2>When Should I See a Doctor? </h2>

If the pain is severe or persists for more than a few days, then it’s important to see a doctor. They can help to diagnose the cause of the pain and recommend the best treatment for you.
