Full time employment is a type of job in which a person works a minimum of 35 hours per week. This is different from part-time employment, in which a person works fewer than 35 hours per week. Full time employment is generally considered to be a more stable form of employment, since it typically includes benefits such as health insurance and paid vacation time.

In business, FT often stands for "full time equivalent," which is a measure of the amount of labor used in a particular period of time.

This is because the two employees are providing the same amount of labor as one full-time employee would provide.
