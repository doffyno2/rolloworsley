<h2>Why Would Someone Slice Your Tire?</h2>

<p>In some cases, the perpetrator may have been trying to steal something from your car and slashed the tire to slow you down in the event that you chased after them. It’s also possible that the tire was slashed as a form of revenge for a perceived wrong or for personal gain.</p>

<h2>How to Tell if Your Tire was Slashed</h2>

<p>If you think your tire may have been slashed, there are a few ways to tell. The first thing to look out for is a patch of rubber on the road. Slashed tires often leave a telltale sign of rubber on the road where the tire was punctured.</p>

<p>If you take a closer look at the tire, you may be able to spot a small hole or a slash in the rubber. It’s worth noting that the hole or slash may not always be visible, depending on the type of blade used. If you can’t see any visible signs of damage, there may be a build-up of air pressure inside the tire which can indicate a puncture.</p>
