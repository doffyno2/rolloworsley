How to Self Adjust a Cuboid Bone

The human body is a complex but intricately beautiful structure, and the cuboid bone is one of its many components. It is responsible for the stability of the foot and ankle and can become misaligned due to various situations such as injuries or postural changes. This can cause pain and discomfort, but fortunately, with the right technique, it is possible to self-adjust the cuboid bone and restore its original position. 



The cuboid bone is a triangular-shaped bone which is located at the top of the foot, on the outside of the ankle joint. It is connected to the fourth and fifth metatarsal bones, and its main function is to provide support and stability to the foot and ankle. If the cuboid bone is out of alignment, it can cause pain and instability during certain activities.

<h2>What Causes Cuboid Syndrome?</h2>

Cuboid syndrome is caused by a misalignment of the cuboid bone, which can be due to a variety of factors. The most common causes of cuboid syndrome include:

<h3>Injuries</h3>

Injuries to the foot, ankle, and lower leg can cause the cuboid bone to become misaligned. This can be due to direct trauma to the area, such as a sprain or fracture, or repetitive strain injuries, such as overuse.

<h3>Footwear</h3>

Wearing uncomfortable or ill-fitting shoes can put excess strain on the foot and ankle, and this can cause the cuboid bone to become misaligned.

<h3>Foot Posture</h3>

If the feet are not in their natural position, the cuboid bone can become misaligned. This can be due to standing or walking with the feet in an unnatural position or for an extended period of time.

<h3>Flat Feet</h3>

Having flat feet can increase the risk of cuboid syndrome, as the feet are not able to support the body as effectively, increasing the strain on the foot and ankle.

<h2>Signs and Symptoms of Cuboid Syndrome</h2>

The most common symptom of cuboid syndrome is pain on the outside of the foot, which can range from mild to severe. Other symptoms include:

<h3>Difficulty Walking</h3>

Due to the instability caused by the misalignment of the cuboid bone, it can be difficult to walk or stand for long periods of time.

<h3>Swelling</h3>

The area around the cuboid bone may become swollen and tender to the touch.

<h3>Instability</h3>

The instability caused by the misalignment of the cuboid bone can make it difficult to stand or walk, as the foot is unable to support the weight of the body.

<h2>How to Self Adjust a Cuboid Bone</h2>

Self-adjusting a cuboid bone requires a few simple steps, and can be done at home.

<h3>Step 1: Locate the Cuboid Bone</h3>

The cuboid bone is located at the top of the foot, on the outside of the ankle joint. It can be felt with the fingers, and when it is misaligned, it will feel like a small bump.

<h3>Step 2: Apply Pressure</h3>

Using the index finger and thumb, apply pressure to the cuboid bone and press it gently back into its original position. This may cause some discomfort, but it should not be painful.

<h3>Step 3: Massage the Area</h3>

After the cuboid bone has been adjusted, massage the area gently to help reduce any swelling and to aid the healing process.
