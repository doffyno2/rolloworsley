<p>Vestibular disease is a common neurological condition in dogs. It is characterized by acute signs of vertigo, such as head tilt, circling, and falling to one side. While vestibular disease is usually idiopathic (of unknown cause), there are certain conditions that can lead to vestibular disease. The most common cause is an inner ear infection. Fortunately, vestibular disease is treatable and most dogs can make a full recovery. In this article, we’ll discuss what vestibular disease is, what causes it, and how to treat it.</p>

<h2>What is Vestibular Disease?</h2>

<p>Vestibular disease is a neurological disorder that affects the balance and coordination of a dog. It is caused by damage or dysfunction of the vestibular system, which consists of the inner ear, the brainstem, and the nerves that connect them. When this system is damaged or not working properly, a dog may experience disorientation, dizziness, head tilt, and circling. Vestibular disease can be either acute (sudden onset) or chronic (long-term).</p>

<h2>What Causes Vestibular Disease?</h2>

<p>Vestibular disease is usually idiopathic, meaning the cause is unknown. However, there are certain conditions that can lead to vestibular disease. These include inner ear infections, tumors, trauma, and autoimmune diseases. Some breeds are more prone to vestibular disease, including Cocker Spaniels and Poodles.</p>

<h2>How is Vestibular Disease Diagnosed?</h2>

<p>If your dog is showing signs of vestibular disease, your veterinarian will perform a physical examination and take a detailed history. The physical examination will assess your dog’s balance and coordination. Your veterinarian may also perform blood work, urinalysis, and imaging tests (such as X-rays or an MRI) to rule out other causes of the symptoms. If an inner ear infection is suspected, your veterinarian may recommend a culture of the ear.</p>

<h2>How is Vestibular Disease Treated?</h2>

<p>The treatment of vestibular disease depends on the underlying cause. If an infection is present, antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove a tumor or correct a structural abnormality. In most cases, the symptoms of vestibular disease will resolve within a few days to weeks. However, it is important to note that some dogs may experience long-term vestibular symptoms.</p>

<h2>What is the Prognosis for Dogs with Vestibular Disease?</h2>

<p>The prognosis for dogs with vestibular disease is generally good. Most dogs will make a full recovery within a few days to weeks. However, some dogs may experience long-term vestibular symptoms. In these cases, physical therapy and medications may be necessary to help manage the symptoms.</p>
