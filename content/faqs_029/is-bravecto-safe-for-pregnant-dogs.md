Owning a pet is a big responsibility that comes with the obligation to ensure their health and safety. When it comes to pregnant dogs, this obligation is even greater. As a dog owner, it's important to be aware of the products and treatments that are safe to use with an expecting mother before, during, and after pregnancy. Bravecto is a flea and tick treatment that is very popular among dog owners, but is it safe to use on pregnant dogs?

<h2>What is Bravecto?</h2>

Bravecto is a flea and tick treatment that is prescribed by veterinarians and is proven to be safe and effective in treating and protecting your pet against fleas, ticks, and other external parasites. Bravecto is a chewable tablet that is easy to administer and is made of fluralaner, an active ingredient that quickly kills fleas, ticks, and other parasites. It is available in two forms: a chewable tablet for dogs and a topical solution for cats.

<h2>Is Bravecto Safe During Pregnancy?</h2>

Although Bravecto is a very effective and safe flea and tick medication, it is not recommended for use during pregnancy. The active ingredient in Bravecto, fluralaner, has not been tested on pregnant dogs, so it is not known whether or not it is safe for their developing puppies. It is best to consult with your veterinarian before administering any flea and tick treatment during pregnancy.

<h2>What are the Alternatives?</h2>

If Bravecto is not suitable for your pregnant dog, there are other treatments that are safe to use. Spot-on products like Advantage Multi, Advantix, and Revolution are safe to use on pregnant dogs. These products work by killing fleas, ticks, and other parasites on contact and provide long-lasting protection against re-infestation. Additionally, shampoos and natural treatments, such as diatomaceous earth, can be used to treat fleas and ticks on pregnant dogs.

<h2>What About After Pregnancy?</h2>

Once your dog has given birth, Bravecto can be safely used to protect your dog and her puppies against fleas and ticks. Bravecto is safe for puppies as young as 8 weeks of age, so it can be used to protect the puppies as soon as they are born. It is important to administer Bravecto as soon as possible to protect your dog and her puppies from fleas, ticks, and other external parasites.
