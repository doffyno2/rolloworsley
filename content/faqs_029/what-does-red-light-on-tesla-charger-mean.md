If you see a red light on your Tesla charger, it means that the vehicle is not receiving power from the outlet. This could be due to a number of different issues, such as a faulty connection or a power outage.

In order to ensure that your Tesla is properly connected to the power source, you should check the cable connections and make sure that they are securely attached to the wall outlet and the Tesla charger. If the connections are loose or not properly attached, the red light will remain lit.
