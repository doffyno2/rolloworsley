<h2>What Are Entities?</h2>

<p>Entities are beings that exist outside of physical form. They are spiritual entities that may appear as ghosts, angels, demons, gods, or other divine beings. They can also be summoned to share knowledge and wisdom or to help with certain tasks. The entities that can be summoned when riding a boat are usually related to water and the sea.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the Ritual</h2>

<p>Before attempting to summon two entities riding a boat, it is important to take the time to prepare the ritual space and the participants.

<h2>Riding the Boat</h2>

<p>Once the entities have been summoned and have agreed to join the boat ride, the participants can board the boat and begin the journey. The participants should sit in the boat and focus their attention on the entities. The participants should allow the entities to guide them on their journey, and should listen for any advice or guidance offered by the entities.</p>
