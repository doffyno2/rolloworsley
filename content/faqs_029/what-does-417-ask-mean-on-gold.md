<p>What is 417 ask? This is a term used in the gold market to describe the current market price of gold. The term is derived from the London Bullion Market Association’s (LBMA) Gold Price which is based on the daily spot gold price. The LBMA Gold Price is determined twice daily using a system of competitive auctions between bullion dealers. Each day at 10:30 am and 3 pm London time, a price is determined for each of the four major gold trading centers: London, Zurich, New York and Tokyo. The 417 ask price is the lowest price at which a bullion dealer is willing to sell gold in the London market. </p>

<p>Gold is a precious metal that has been used as a store of value and form of currency for centuries. The price of gold is determined by a number of factors, including the availability of the metal in the market, the state of the global economy, and geopolitical events. Gold prices can fluctuate rapidly and have been known to move both up and down by large percentages in a single day. As such, investors who buy or sell gold must pay attention to the current market price.</p>
