<p>Starting a Stihl backpack blower can be a daunting task. Knowing how to properly choke a Stihl backpack blower is essential for a successful start. This guide will provide helpful tips and tricks for starting a Stihl backpack blower, and provides an overview of the choke settings for a Stihl backpack blower.</p>

<h2>The Basics of Choking a Stihl Backpack Blower</h2>

<p>Choking a Stihl backpack blower is a simple process that requires a few key steps. First, make sure the fuel tank is full and the fuel lines are clear of any debris. Next, locate the choke lever on the Stihl backpack blower and set it to the ‘on’ position. Next, locate the spark plug and make sure it is clean and in good working order.

<h2>The Three Choke Settings on a Stihl Backpack Blower</h2>

<p>Stihl backpack blowers offer three separate choke settings which are controlled by the choke lever. The first is the ‘on’ position, which is the most commonly used setting. The ‘on’ position allows the engine to draw air and fuel from the carburetor and mix them together for a successful start. The second position is the ‘off’ position, which shuts off the fuel flow and prevents the engine from starting. The third position is the ‘half-choke’ position which is used to help the engine start in cold weather. In this position, the engine will draw a limited amount of air and fuel from the carburetor and mix them together for a successful start.</p>

For a warm start, set the choke lever to the ‘on’ position. Make sure to properly prime the engine before pulling the starter rope. Pull the starter rope gently until the engine starts.</p>
