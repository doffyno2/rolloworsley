<p>Salesforce is a powerful customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage customer data, increase sales, and improve customer service. It also offers certifications, including the Salesforce Administrator Certification and Salesforce Advanced Administrator Certification. Both of these certifications require regular maintenance exams to keep the certifications active.</p>

<p>If you miss a maintenance exam, you will not be able to keep your certifications active. Maintenance exams are required every 12 months for both the Salesforce Administrator Certification and the Salesforce Advanced Administrator Certification. If you fail to take the maintenance exam within the 12-month period, your certification will become inactive and you will need to retake the exam in order to become certified again.</p>

<p>When your certification becomes inactive, you will no longer be able to access the benefits associated with the certification. This includes access to the Salesforce Partner Community, the Salesforce AppExchange, and the Salesforce User Groups. Additionally, any discounts associated with the certification will no longer be available. </p>

<p>If you find yourself in the situation of missing a maintenance exam, there are a few options that you can consider. First, you can take the maintenance exam as soon as possible. If you take the exam within six months of the expiration date, your certification will be extended for an additional six months. If you take the exam after six months, but within 12 months, your certification will be extended for an additional three months. </p>

<p>If you are unable to take the maintenance exam within the 12-month period, you can apply for a one-time extension. This extension is only available once and is valid for up to six months. You must submit a formal request for the extension and provide documentation of your inability to take the exam. </p>

<p>Finally, if you are unable to take the maintenance exam within 18 months of the expiration date, you must retake the certification exam. This means you will need to retake the entire certification exam and will not receive credit for any of the maintenance exams already completed. </p>

<h2>How to Prepare for a Maintenance Exam</h2>

<p>Preparing for a maintenance exam is similar to preparing for any other certification exam. You will need to review the material covered in the original certification exam and familiarize yourself with any new features or changes in Salesforce since the original exam. Additionally, you can use practice tests to familiarize yourself with the exam format and question types.</p>

<p>If you have not completed the original certification exam, it is highly recommended that you do so before attempting the maintenance exam. This will ensure that you are familiar with all of the material covered in the maintenance exam and will help ensure a better score on the exam. </p>

<h2>What Is the Difference Between a Maintenance Exam and a Certification Exam?</h2>

<p>A maintenance exam is a shorter version of a certification exam. It covers the same material as the original certification exam, but is shorter and more focused. Maintenance exams are designed to ensure that certified professionals remain up-to-date on the latest Salesforce features and changes. </p>

<p>In contrast, a certification exam is a full-length exam that covers a wide range of topics. Certification exams are designed to ensure that certified professionals have a thorough understanding of the Salesforce platform and can apply it in a professional setting. </p>
