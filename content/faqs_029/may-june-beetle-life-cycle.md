The May-June beetle, or Phyllophaga, is a common species of scarab beetle found throughout North America. These small beetles are found in gardens, lawns, and other areas with plenty of vegetation. Although they are relatively harmless and are considered beneficial because they feed on decaying plant matter, they can become a nuisance when they swarm in large numbers in the late spring and early summer months. To better understand these beetles and how to control them, it is important to learn more about their life cycle.

<h2>What Is the May-June Beetle?</h2>

The May-June beetle is a member of the family Scarabaeidae, which includes over 30,000 species of beetles found all over the world. The May-June beetle is specifically a species of the Phyllophaga genus and is found in North America from Canada to Mexico. It is characterized by its reddish-brown color and its distinctive oval shape. These beetles are nocturnal and typically emerge from the soil to feed on decaying plant matter at night.

<h2>Where Are They Found?</h2>

The May-June beetle is found in areas with plenty of vegetation, including gardens, lawns, shrubbery, and wooded areas. They are especially common in the eastern and southern parts of North America, although they can be found in other regions as well. They typically emerge from the soil in the late spring and early summer months and can be quite abundant during this time.

<h2>What Is Their Life Cycle?</h2>

The May-June beetle has a lifecycle that spans several years. The female beetle lays her eggs in the soil in the late summer and early fall months. The eggs then hatch in the spring, usually between April and June. The larvae, or grubs, feed on decaying plant matter and live in the soil for about three years before emerging as adults. The adults then mate and lay eggs, beginning the cycle again.

<h2>How Do They Reproduce?</h2>

The female May-June beetle will lay her eggs in the soil in the late summer and early fall months. The eggs are small and white and are typically laid in clusters of up to 500 eggs. After hatching, the larvae feed on decaying plant matter and live in the soil for about 3 years before emerging as adults. The adults then mate and lay eggs, beginning the cycle again.

<h2>What Do They Eat?</h2>

The larvae of the May-June beetle feed on decaying plant matter, including roots, stems, and leaves. The adults feed on a variety of plants, including grasses, clover, and other vegetation. They are especially attracted to fruits, vegetables, and flowers, so they may damage gardens and other areas with plenty of vegetation.

<h2>What Are the Signs of an Infestation?</h2>

The most obvious sign of a May-June beetle infestation is the presence of adult beetles in large numbers in the late spring and early summer months. Other signs include the presence of larvae in the soil and damage to plants and vegetation.

<h2>How Can They Be Controlled?</h2>

The best way to control May-June beetles is to keep the area around your home or garden free of decaying plant matter. This will reduce the food supply for the larvae and discourage them from staying in the area. Chemical treatments are also available to kill both adult beetles and larvae, but it is important to use these treatments carefully and according to the directions on the label.
