Mango worms are tiny, parasitic nematode worms that can infect humans, animals, and plants in tropical areas. The worms are found in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, India, Southeast Asia, and the Caribbean. They are also known as cutaneous larva migrans or creeping eruption.

Mango worms are most commonly found in soil and can be present in water, particularly in areas where animal feces or other organic matter is present. The worms can also be found in fruits, vegetables, and other food materials.

Humans become infected when they come into contact with soil or water that is contaminated with the eggs or larvae of the mango worm. The eggs hatch in the soil and the larvae enter the human body through the skin, often through cuts and scratches. The larvae then migrate through the skin, causing itching and inflammation.

<h2>Symptoms of Mango Worms</h2>

The most common symptom of mango worms is itching and redness of the skin. This is caused by the larvae moving through the skin. Other symptoms may include:

- Swelling, bumps, and blisters on the skin
- Skin lesions that appear as red lines
- Pain and tenderness in the affected area
- Pus-filled lesions or abscesses
- Low-grade fever

<h2>Diagnosis of Mango Worms</h2>

Diagnosis of mango worms is typically done by a doctor who will examine the affected area. They may also take a sample of the skin to look for the larvae of the mango worms. In some cases, a biopsy of the skin may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

<h2>Treatment of Mango Worms</h2>

Treatment of mango worms typically involves medications to kill the worms and reduce inflammation. These medications may include an oral or topical anti-parasitic, such as albendazole, ivermectin, or thiabendazole. Topical steroids may also be prescribed to reduce inflammation.

In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the larvae and the surrounding tissue. The affected area may also need to be cleaned and dressed to prevent infection.

<h2>Prevention of Mango Worms</h2>

The best way to prevent mango worms is to avoid contact with soil, water, and other materials that may be contaminated with the eggs or larvae of the mango worms. Wear protective clothing, such as long pants and long sleeves, when working or playing in areas where mango worms may be present.
