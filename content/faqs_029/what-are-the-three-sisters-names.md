The Three Sisters are the three goddesses of fate and destiny in Greek mythology. They are Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos. Their names signify their roles in the mythological cycle of life and death. Clotho, the youngest of the Three Sisters, is the spinner of life's thread. She spins the thread of life from her distaff onto her spindle, determining the length of each individual's life. Lachesis, the middle sister, measures the thread of life that Clotho has spun, determining how much each individual will experience in their lifetime. Atropos, the eldest and most feared of the Three Sisters, is the cutter of life's thread. Using her scissors, she cuts the thread of life when it is time for someone to die.
