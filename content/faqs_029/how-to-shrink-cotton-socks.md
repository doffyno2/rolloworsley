<h2>What Are Cotton Socks?</h2>
Cotton socks are a type of clothing accessory that come in many different styles and fabrics. They are often made with a combination of cotton and polyester, but some varieties are made entirely of cotton. Cotton socks have been popular for many years, and they are known for their breathability and comfort. Cotton socks are also very durable, making them ideal for heavy wear.

<h2>Why Do People Shrink Cotton Socks?</h2>

<h3>Step 5: Remove The Socks</h3>
