<p>Having an active lifestyle is beneficial for your overall health, but when it comes to working your muscles, there is a point when too much of a good thing can become dangerous. It's important to understand the risks of overworking your muscles and how to properly work them in order to avoid potentially serious health problems. </p>

<h2>What Is Muscle Overwork?</h2>

<p>Muscle overwork occurs when you exercise your muscles beyond their normal range of motion. This can happen through repetitive motions that strain the muscle, such as lifting weights, running, or playing sports. Muscle overwork can also occur when you don’t give your muscles enough time to rest and recover after a workout. </p>

<h2>What Are the Signs of Muscle Overwork?</h2>

<p>The signs of muscle overwork can vary depending on the severity of the injury. Common signs of overworking your muscles include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Pain or tenderness in the affected area</li>
    <li>Muscle weakness or fatigue</li>
    <li>Stiffness or reduced range of motion</li>
    <li>Swelling or inflammation</li>
    <li>Reduced strength or endurance</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Are the Risks of Overworking Your Muscles?</h2>
