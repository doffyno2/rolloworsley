<h2>What are Travel Funds?</h2>

<p>Travel funds are a type of credit that Southwest Airlines offers when a customer cancels a reservation or makes changes to a reservation. These funds can be used to purchase a new ticket with Southwest, or can be applied to an existing ticket. Travel funds are valid for 12 months from the date they are issued.</p>

<h2>How do I Redeem My Travel Funds?</h2>

<p>Travel funds can be redeemed in a few different ways. The most common way to redeem travel funds is through the Southwest Airlines website. You will need to log in to your Southwest account and access the “My Travel Funds” section. Here you will be able to view and manage your travel funds. If you have multiple travel funds, you can select which one you want to use to purchase your ticket.</p>

<p>You can also redeem your travel funds over the phone by calling Southwest Airlines Customer Service. You will need to provide your travel funds code and your desired flight information. The customer service representative will then apply the travel funds to your purchase.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on the Use of Travel Funds?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are some restrictions on the use of travel funds. Travel funds cannot be used to purchase seats that are subject to a fare difference, such as a Business Select seat or an Anytime seat. They also cannot be used to purchase EarlyBird Check-In, or to pay for government taxes. Additionally, travel funds cannot be used to purchase a ticket for someone else.</p>

<h2>What Happens If I Don’t Use All of My Travel Funds?</h2>

<p>If you don’t use all of your travel funds, the remaining amount will be kept in your Southwest account for future use. Travel funds are valid for 12 months from the date they are issued, so you have plenty of time to use them. You can check the expiration date of your travel funds in the “My Travel Funds” section of your Southwest account.</p>
