<p>When you are expecting a package to arrive, you may be curious to know what a delivery exception means and why it has happened. Delivery exceptions are a common occurrence in the United States Postal Service (USPS) delivery system and can happen for several different reasons. It is important to understand the different types of delivery exceptions and the steps you can take to resolve the issue.</p>

<h2>What is a Delivery Exception?</h2>

<p>A delivery exception is a term used by the USPS to describe a situation where a package or mailpiece is unable to be delivered as addressed. This can be due to several different reasons such as incorrect or incomplete address information, the package being too large for the delivery footprint, or even due to severe weather conditions. In most cases, a delivery exception will result in the package being returned to the sender.</p>

<h2>Types of Delivery Exceptions</h2>

<p>The USPS identifies four different types of delivery exceptions:</p>

<h3>1. Address Not Found</h3>

<p>The USPS will return a package as an address not found if the address was incorrect, incomplete, or outdated.  It is important to double-check the address of the recipient before sending any package to ensure it is up to date and accurate.</p>

<h3>2. Delivery Area Not Serviced</h3>

<p>The USPS will return a package as a delivery area not serviced if the address is in an area that is not serviced by the USPS. This can include rural areas or areas that are too remote for the USPS to deliver.</p>

<h3>3. Package Too Large</h3>

<p>The USPS will return a package as a package too large if it is larger than the maximum size allowed for delivery. The maximum size for a package is 108 inches in total length and girth combined.</p>

<h3>4. Severe Weather Delay</h3>

<p>The USPS will return a package as a severe weather delay if the area is experiencing severe weather conditions such as snowstorms, hurricanes, or floods. In this case, the package will be returned to the sender once the weather conditions have improved.</p>

<h2>What to Do When You Have a Delivery Exception</h2>

<p>If you have received a delivery exception from the USPS, there are several steps you can take to resolve the issue. First, you should check the tracking information on the package and determine what type of exception it is. Once you have identified the type of exception, you can take the appropriate steps to resolve it. For example, if the package is an address not found, you can update the address information and resend the package. If the package is too large or there is a severe weather delay, you may need to wait until the conditions improve before resending the package.</p>
