Luxating patella, or slipping kneecap, is a common condition in dogs that can cause severe pain and lameness. If your dog has been diagnosed with this condition, you may be wondering what brace you should use to help provide relief and protect your pup from further damage. In this article, we'll discuss the types of braces available for treating luxating patella and how to select the right one for your pup.

<h2>What is Luxating Patella?</h2>

Luxating patella is a condition in which the kneecap becomes dislocated or slips out of place. This can cause pain and lameness in the affected leg. This condition is usually caused by a malformation of the knee joint, which can be congenital or acquired through injury. Depending on the severity of the condition, treatment may include medication, surgery, and/or the use of a brace.

<h2>Types of Braces for Luxating Patella</h2>

There are several types of braces available for treating luxating patella. These include neoprene knee wraps, hinged braces, and custom-made braces.

<h3>Neoprene Knee Wraps</h3>

Neoprene knee wraps are the most common type of braces used for treating luxating patella. They are made of a soft, flexible material that wraps around the knee and provides support and stability. Neoprene wraps are easy to put on and remove, making them a convenient option for dogs with luxating patella.

<h3>Hinged Braces</h3>

Hinged braces are a more supportive option than neoprene wraps. They provide more stability by using hinges to lock the knee in place. These braces are usually made of plastic or metal and are designed to fit snugly around the knee. They are more difficult to put on and take off, so they require assistance from a veterinary professional.

<h3>Custom-Made Braces</h3>

Custom-made braces are the most supportive option for treating luxating patella. These braces are designed and manufactured to fit your dog's specific condition. They provide the highest level of support and stability and can be adjusted to provide the perfect fit. Custom-made braces are the most expensive option and require a veterinarian's prescription.

<h2>How to Select the Right Brace for Your Dog</h2>

When selecting a brace for your dog's luxating patella, you should consider the severity of your dog's condition, the type of brace that best suits your pup's needs, and your budget. Your veterinarian can advise you on the best type of brace for your pup's condition and can help you select the right size and fit.
