<h2>What is a Speed Out?</h2>

<p>A speed out is a small, hand-held tool that is used to remove broken screws, bolts, and other objects from different surfaces.

It is a great tool for anyone who needs to quickly and easily remove stripped screws or bolts without damaging the surface.</p>

<h2>How Does a Speed Out Work?</h2>

<p>The speed out is designed to easily fit into the stripped head of a screw or bolt. It works by using a reverse thread that is slightly larger than the original thread of the screw or bolt. When the speed out is inserted into the stripped head, it creates a reverse thread that is larger than the original thread, allowing the broken object to be unscrewed and removed from the surface.
