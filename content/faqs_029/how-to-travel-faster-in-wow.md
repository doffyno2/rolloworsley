<p>World of Warcraft is one of the most popular MMORPGs out there, and with it comes the necessity for fast travel. Whether you’re an Alliance or Horde player, there are a variety of ways to get around Azeroth in an efficient manner. Here’s a look at some of the travel methods available to you in World of Warcraft and how to use them.</p>

<h2>Portals</h2>

<p>Portals are one of the most convenient and quickest ways to get around Azeroth. There are portals located in cities, towns and villages that can teleport you to other locations on the same continent. It’s important to note that you must be level 20 or above to use a portal. The portals are generally located near flight masters and are marked with a purple swirl.</p>

<p>To use a portal, simply click on it and you will be presented with a list of destination portals you can choose from. You can also open your world map and select a location, and then click on the “Teleport” option to be taken to that location.</p>

<h2>Flight Masters</h2>

<p>Flight Masters are located in cities, towns and villages around Azeroth, and they can be used to travel to any location on the same continent. To use a Flight Master, you must be level 10 or above and have trained in the “Flying” skill. This skill can be obtained from any Flight Master for a small fee.</p>

<p>Once you have trained in the “Flying” skill, you can speak to a Flight Master and purchase a flight ticket to a specific location. To do so, open your world map and select the destination, then click “Buy Ticket” and follow the instructions.</p>

<h2>Hearthstone</h2>

<p>Hearthstone is an item that can be used to teleport the player to their chosen “home” location. This item can be purchased from vendors in cities, towns and villages and can be used an unlimited number of times. To use a Hearthstone, simply right-click on it in your inventory and choose the “Activate” option.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the Hearthstone will take 10 minutes to activate, so it’s best to use this method of travel when you’re in no hurry. Additionally, you can only use the Hearthstone to travel to your home location, so it’s not useful for travelling to other locations.</p>

<h2>Boats</h2>

<p>Boats are another convenient way to get around Azeroth. Boats are located in cities, towns and villages, and they can be used to travel to other locations on the same continent. To use a boat, simply speak to the boat captain and purchase a ticket to the desired location.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that boats are often slower than other methods of travel, so it’s best to use them when you’re not in a hurry. Additionally, boats cannot be used to travel across continents, so they’re not a viable option for long-distance travel.</p>

<h2>Zeppelins</h2>

<p>Zeppelins are a great way to travel between continents. Zeppelins are located in cities and they can be used to travel to other locations on a different continent. To use a Zeppelin, simply speak to the Zeppelin Master and purchase a ticket to the desired location.</p>

<p>It’s important to note that Zeppelins are the fastest way to travel between continents, but they can be expensive. Additionally, some locations do not have Zeppelins, so it’s best to check your world map before buying a ticket.</p>
