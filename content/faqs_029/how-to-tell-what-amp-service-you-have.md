<p>If you’re a homeowner or business owner, you might be wondering what type of amp service you have. In order to answer this question, you’ll need to do a bit of research. Knowing what kind of amp service you have can help you make decisions about how to use your electricity more efficiently and save money in the long run.</p>

<h2>What is Amp Service?</h2>

<p>Amp service is the amount of electricity a home or business needs to run. It’s measured in amps, which are a measure of electrical current. Different types of appliances and electronics require different amounts of electricity, so the amount of amp service you have will determine how much you can use at one time. </p>

<h2>What Are the Different Types of Amp Service?</h2>

<p>There are three main types of amp service: single-phase, two-phase, and three-phase. Single-phase service is the most common type of amp service and is typically used for residential homes. Single-phase service is delivered to a home or business on one line and is measured in amps. Two-phase service is typically used for light industrial applications and is typically delivered on two lines. It’s measured in amps and volts. Three-phase service is typically used for commercial and industrial applications and is delivered on three lines. It’s measured in amps, volts, and hertz.</p>

<h2>How Can I Tell What Type of Amp Service I Have?</h2>

<p>The first step in determining what type of amp service you have is to contact your local electric company. Your electric company will be able to tell you what type of service you have and what your current capacity is. You can also contact a qualified electrician who can inspect your home or business to determine what type of amp service you have.</p>

<h2>What Else Do I Need to Know About Amp Service?</h2>
