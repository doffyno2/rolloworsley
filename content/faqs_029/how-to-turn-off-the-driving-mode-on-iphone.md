How to Turn Off Driving Mode on iPhone

As an iPhone user, you may have heard of something called “driving mode”. It’s a feature that lets you have a safer and more convenient driving experience, by blocking incoming calls and notifications while you’re on the road. 



Driving mode is a feature that automatically turns on when your iPhone detects that you’re in a moving vehicle. When this happens, any incoming calls or notifications are blocked until you stop driving. This helps prevent distractions while driving, and encourages safer driving habits. 



Driving mode works by tracking your location and velocity with the help of GPS and cellular networks. When the iPhone detects that your vehicle is in motion, it automatically turns on driving mode. This mode will remain active until your iPhone detects that you’ve stopped moving, at which point it will turn off. 



If you’d like to turn off driving mode, you can do so in a few simple steps. Here’s how:
