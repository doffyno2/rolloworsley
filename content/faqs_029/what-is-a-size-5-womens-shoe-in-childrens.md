The size of a woman's shoe can vary greatly depending on the manufacturer, the style of the shoe, and the country of origin. When it comes to children’s shoes, however, there are some standard sizes that are used to make sure the shoes fit correctly. Knowing the equivalency between women’s and children’s sizes can help you make sure you buy the correct shoes for your child.

<h2>Women's Shoe Sizes</h2>

Women's shoe sizes usually range from a size 5 (European size 35) to a size 11 (European size 43). The size of a woman's shoe is usually measured in millimeters, with each size increment typically representing a 1.5 millimeter increase.

<h2>Children's Shoe Sizes</h2>

Children's shoes are usually sized using a different system of sizing than women's shoes, as they are typically measured in inches. Children's shoe sizes usually range from a size 8 (UK size 8) to a size 13 (UK size 13). The size of a child's shoe is usually measured in inches, with each size increment typically representing a 1/3 inch increase.
