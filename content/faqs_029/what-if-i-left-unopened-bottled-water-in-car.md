<p>Most of us have been in a situation where we've left a bottle of water in our car and then, hours later, wondered if it was still safe to drink. After all, it's been exposed to the heat of the day, and while it might not be boiling hot, we know that temperatures can still get high in a car. But is it still safe to drink? </p>

<p>The answer is yes, you can still drink water that's been left unopened in a car, but there are some things you should know first. We'll explain the risks and how to keep your bottled water safe to drink.</p>

<h2>What Happens to Water When it's Left Unopened in a Car?</h2>

<p>When a bottle of water is left unopened in a car, the temperature of the water can rise significantly. As the car heats up, the air in the bottle will expand, causing the water to heat up. This can cause a significant rise in temperature, and while it won't reach boiling point, it could still get hot enough to make the water unsafe to drink.</p>

<p>When water is heated, it can cause the chemical composition to change. This can lead to the growth of bacteria, and if the water gets hot enough, it can even cause the plastic bottle to leach harmful chemicals into the water.</p>

<h2>How to Keep Water Safe to Drink in a Car</h2>

<p>There are a few ways to keep bottled water safe to drink in a car. The first is to keep it in an insulated bag or container. This will help to keep the temperature of the water lower, and will slow down the rate of temperature increase. It's also a good idea to choose a container that's light in color, as darker colors will absorb more of the heat from the sun.</p>

<p>It's also important to store your bottled water away from direct sunlight. If possible, move it to a shady spot in the car, or put a towel over the top of it. This will help to keep the water cooler, and also help to stop the growth of bacteria. </p>

<p>Once you've done all that, you should also make sure to check the temperature of the water regularly. If it's too hot to touch, then it's not safe to drink. Instead, throw it away and get a new bottle.</p>

<h2>Can You Refreeze Melted Ice in Bottled Water?</h2>

<p>It's not recommended to refreeze melted ice in bottled water. This is because when ice melts, it can cause the chemical composition of the water to change, which can make it unsafe to drink. Additionally, when ice melts, it can create a warm, moist environment in the bottle that is ideal for bacteria growth. This means that if you refreeze the melted ice, you could be drinking contaminated water.</p>

<h2>Is it Safe to Leave Water in the Car Overnight?</h2>

<p>It's not recommended to leave water in a car overnight. This is because temperatures can drop significantly overnight, and this can cause the water to freeze. This can cause the bottle to expand and crack, which can be dangerous if you're not careful. Additionally, if the water does freeze, it can also cause the chemical composition of the water to change, making it unsafe to drink. </p>
