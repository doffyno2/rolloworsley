<p>Clash of Clans is a widely popular mobile game developed by Supercell. It is a strategic game that requires players to build and manage their own village and army. As with any online game, there are times when the game must be taken offline for maintenance. This is known as a maintenance break.</p>

<p>During a maintenance break, Clash of Clans servers are taken offline and all players are unable to connect to the game. This is done in order to perform updates and other necessary tasks that must be done on the game's servers. Maintenance breaks typically last several hours, although the duration can vary depending on the type of maintenance being performed.</p>

<p>During a maintenance break, players are unable to access their Clash of Clans village or army. This means that no progress can be made and no new troops or buildings can be created. However, players are still able to access their Clan chat, which allows them to communicate with their Clan members.</p>

<p>Maintenance breaks are also used to fix any bugs or issues that may be affecting the game. This is done to ensure that the game runs smoothly and that players are not experiencing any problems. Maintenance breaks are also used to introduce new content to the game, such as new troops, buildings, and game modes.</p>

<p>When a maintenance break is scheduled, Supercell will usually inform players via their official social media accounts. This allows players to plan accordingly and make sure that they are not trying to access the game while it is offline. Supercell will also usually give players a rough estimate of when the maintenance break will end, so they know when they can expect to be able to play again.</p>
