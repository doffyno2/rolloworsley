<p>Have you ever wondered which countries in the world don't contain the letter 'A' in their name? While it may seem like an unusual question, it can be surprising to learn that there are actually quite a few countries that don't have the letter 'A' in their name. In this article, we'll explore the countries that don't contain the letter 'A', and why these countries have been excluded from the alphabetical list. </p>

<p>It's interesting to note that some of these countries are quite small and aren't well known to many people. For example, Nauru is the smallest republic in the world, with a population of less than 11,000 people. The Marshall Islands is a collection of islands in the Pacific Ocean, and Kiribati is a group of 33 islands located in the central Pacific Ocean.</p> 

<h2>Why Don't These Countries Have the Letter A?</h2>

<p>The answer to this question is quite simple: it's due to the nature of the language used in the country's name. All of the countries mentioned above use a language that does not include the letter 'A'. For example, Bhutan is a country located in the Himalayas and its official language is Dzongkha. Dzongkha does not include the letter 'A' in its alphabet, which is why Bhutan is excluded from the alphabetical list.</p>

<p>The other countries mentioned have similar stories. For example, Kiribati is a country located in the Pacific Ocean and its official language is Gilbertese. Gilbertese does not include the letter 'A', which is why it is also excluded from the alphabetical list. The same can be said for Comoros, Djibouti, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, San Marino, Seychelles, Singapore, Tuvalu, Uruguay, Vatican City and Zimbabwe.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>It can be quite surprising to learn that there are a few countries that don't contain the letter 'A' in their name.
