<p>Plan B is a type of emergency contraception or birth control that is designed to be taken after unprotected intercourse or if another form of birth control has failed. It has been around since 1999, and it is available over-the-counter in the United States. It is a safe and effective way to prevent pregnancy, but it should be taken as soon as possible after unprotected sex.</p>

<p>Plan B consists of two pills that contain levonorgestrel, a hormone that is similar to the progesterone normally produced by the body. The pills must be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. If taken within 72 hours, it is 95% effective in preventing pregnancy. The sooner it is taken, the more effective it is. After 72 hours, the effectiveness decreases significantly.</p>

<p>But what happens if you take Plan B after its expiration date? Is it still effective? Unfortunately, there is not a lot of research on what happens if you take Plan B past the expiration date, but it is generally accepted that the effectiveness decreases significantly. In other words, it is unlikely that Plan B will be effective after its expiration date.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Plan B does not work if you are already pregnant. It will not terminate a pregnancy, and it is not an abortion pill. It is simply a form of emergency contraception that is designed to prevent pregnancy. It should not be used as a regular form of birth control.</p>

<h2>What Happens if You Take Expired Plan B - Is It Still Effective?</h2>

<p>The short answer is that Plan B is unlikely to be effective if taken past its expiration date. The hormone in Plan B (levonorgestrel) has been found to break down over time, meaning that its effectiveness decreases with time. This is why it is important to take Plan B as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse.</p>

<p>It is also important to remember that Plan B is not 100% effective in preventing pregnancy even if taken within the 72-hour window. It is estimated to be 95% effective if taken within 72 hours. This means that there is still a 5% chance of pregnancy even if Plan B is taken correctly.</p>

<h2>What Are the Side Effects of Taking Expired Plan B?</h2>

<p>The side effects of taking Plan B past its expiration date are unknown, as there is not enough research on this topic. However, it is generally accepted that taking Plan B past its expiration date is unlikely to be effective in preventing pregnancy.</p>

<p>It is important to remember that Plan B can cause side effects even when taken correctly. These side effects are usually mild and include nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and breast tenderness. These side effects should resolve on their own and should not last for more than a few days.</p>

<h2>What Are the Alternatives to Taking Expired Plan B?</h2>

<p>If you have taken Plan B past its expiration date, there are other options available. The most reliable form of emergency contraception is the copper intrauterine device (IUD). This device is inserted into the uterus and prevents pregnancy for up to 10 years. It is more effective than Plan B, and it is recommended that it be inserted within 5 days of unprotected intercourse.</p>

<p>Another option is to take a different emergency contraceptive. There are several brands available, including Ella and Next Choice. These emergency contraceptives contain different hormones than Plan B and are effective up to 5 days after unprotected intercourse.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Taking Plan B past its expiration date is unlikely to be effective in preventing pregnancy. If you have taken Plan B past its expiration date, there are other options available, such as the copper IUD or other emergency contraceptives. It is important to remember that Plan B is not 100% effective even when taken correctly, so it is important to discuss all of your options with your healthcare provider.</p>
