<p>Dark circles under the eyes of a dog can be a sign of many underlying issues.

This article will explore the causes and possible treatments for dark circles under the eyes of a dog. </p>

<h2>What Are Dark Circles Under a Dog's Eyes? </h2>

<p>Dark circles under a dog's eyes, also referred to as "tear stains," are dark patches of discolored fur that appear directly beneath the eyes. The fur surrounding the eyes may also appear to be darker than the rest of the coat. These stains can be caused by a number of factors, including diet, allergies, or medical issues. While some dogs may have naturally darker fur beneath their eyes, dark circles that appear suddenly may be a sign of an underlying health issue. </p>

<p>There are several common causes of dark circles under a dog's eyes. These include:</p>
