<p>Have you ever heard a strange, loud knocking sound when you go over bumps or drive on rough roads? It can be a worrisome experience and can lead to significant damage to your vehicle if left unchecked. In this article, weâ€™ll cover the most common causes of a knocking sound when going over bumps and how to fix them.</p>

<h2>What Causes Knocking Sound When Going Over Bumps?</h2>

<p>The most common cause of a knocking sound when going over bumps is loose or worn suspension components. When the suspension components have worn out, they become unable to absorb the impact of bumps and potholes, leading to a loud knocking sound. Additionally, a worn steering system can cause the same problem. When the steering components become worn, they are unable to compensate for the uneven surfaces and will cause a knocking sound when you go over bumps.</p>

<p>Another common cause of a knocking sound when going over bumps is a worn wheel bearing. When the wheel bearing has worn out, it will cause the wheel to move independently from the suspension, leading to a knocking sound when going over bumps.</p>

<h2>How to Diagnose a Knocking Sound When Going Over Bumps?</h2>

<p>The first step in diagnosing a knocking sound when going over bumps is to check the suspension components for any signs of wear or damage. This can be done by jacking up the vehicle and inspecting the suspension components for any signs of damage. Additionally, you can check the wheel bearing by jacking up the wheel and shaking it. If the wheel bearing is worn, it will have play in it and will create a knocking sound when it is shaken.</p>

<p>Once the suspension components have been checked, the next step is to inspect the steering system. This can be done by checking the steering linkage for any signs of wear or damage. Additionally, you can check the steering wheel for any signs of play or looseness. If the steering wheel has any play or looseness, the steering system may need to be serviced or replaced.</p>

<h2>How to Fix a Knocking Sound When Going Over Bumps?</h2>

<p>The first step in fixing a knocking sound when going over bumps is to replace any worn suspension components. This can be done by replacing the shocks, struts, and springs as needed. Additionally, worn steering components should be replaced as well. This includes the steering linkage, steering wheel, and other components. Once the worn components have been replaced, the next step is to check the wheel bearing. If the wheel bearing is worn, it will need to be replaced.</p>

<p>Once all of the worn components have been replaced, the next step is to check the alignment of the vehicle. An alignment is necessary to ensure that the wheels are in proper alignment with the suspension. This can be done at most auto repair shops. Once the alignment has been completed, the vehicle should be checked for any other signs of wear or damage. If any additional repairs are needed, they should be completed as soon as possible.</p>
