<p>A GE Profile stove is a great addition to any kitchen, and it can be used to cook delicious meals. But if you’ve accidentally locked the stove, it can be tricky to figure out how to unlock it. Fortunately, it’s relatively easy to unlock a GE Profile stove, and in this article we’ll show you how.</p>

<h2>What Causes a GE Profile Stove to Lock?</h2> 

<p>The first step to unlocking a GE Profile stove is understanding what causes the stove to lock in the first place. The most common cause of a locked stove is that the oven has been accidentally set to Self Clean mode. Self Clean mode is designed to reach temperatures of up to 650°F in order to clean the stove’s oven cavity. This is an incredibly high temperature and can be dangerous, so the stove locks itself while it’s in this mode. </p>

<h2>How to Unlock a GE Profile Stove</h2>

<p>Now that you understand why your GE Profile stove is locked, you can begin to unlock it. The first step is to press the Clear/Off button for three seconds. This will disable Self Clean mode and unlock the oven. If the oven does not unlock, try pressing and holding the Clear/Off button for five seconds. If this does not work, you may need to unplug the stove and plug it back in. Once the oven is unlocked, you can press the Clear/Off button again to turn off the oven.</p>

<h2>What to Do After Unlocking a GE Profile Stove</h2>

<p>Once you’ve unlocked your GE Profile stove, you may want to take some steps to prevent it from locking again in the future. First, make sure that you are aware of where the Self Clean button is and how to use it properly. You should also check the manual to make sure that you know how to use all of the stove’s features safely. Finally, be sure to keep the stove clean so that you don’t have to use Self Clean mode very often.</p>
