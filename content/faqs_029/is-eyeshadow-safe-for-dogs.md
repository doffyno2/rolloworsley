<p>Most people know that dogs have sensitive eyes, and that it’s important to use products that are specifically designed for canine use when grooming their pet. But what about eyeshadow? Is it safe to use on dogs?</p>

<p>The answer is yes – eyeshadow is generally safe to use on dogs, depending on the type of eyeshadow you use. However, there are a few important considerations to take into account before applying eyeshadow to your pet. </p>

<h2>How to Choose the Right Eyeshadow for Dogs </h2>

<p>When shopping for eyeshadow for your dog, it’s important to purchase products that are specifically designed for canine use. This means that the eyeshadow should be free of chemicals and fragrances, and should be non-toxic and safe for use around your pet. It’s also important to make sure that the eyeshadow is not too harsh or abrasive for your pet’s eyes, as this could potentially cause irritation and discomfort.</p>

<p>When selecting eyeshadow for your pet, it’s also important to consider their breed and coat type. Many eyeshadow products are designed to work best on certain breeds and coat types, so it’s important to select the right product for your pet. </p>
