<p>Fishing is a popular pastime in New Jersey, and the state has plenty of freshwater and saltwater fishing opportunities. If you're planning to fish in saltwater in New Jersey, however, you'll need a saltwater fishing license. This article will explain why a license is required and how to get one.</p>

<h2>Why Do You Need a Saltwater Fishing License In New Jersey?</h2>

<p>New Jersey requires anyone over the age of 16 to obtain a saltwater fishing license before fishing in saltwater. This is true whether you're fishing from the shore, from a boat, or from a pier. It's important to note that the license is not required for freshwater fishing.</p>

<p>The main reason for the saltwater fishing license requirement is to protect marine resources. Fishing in saltwater can be very damaging to the marine ecosystems, and the license helps ensure that fishermen are following regulations and not taking too many fish. Additionally, the license fees help pay for conservation efforts, research, and management of the state's fishing resources.</p>

<h2>Who Is Exempt From the Saltwater Fishing License Requirement?</h2>

<p>In some cases, you may not need to get a saltwater fishing license. You're exempt from the license requirement if you're fishing in a privately-owned pond or lake. You're also exempt if you're fishing in a marine district that doesn't require a license.</p>

<p>Additionally, you won't need a license if you're fishing from a public pier. However, you must have a valid fishing permit from the pier's owner. Finally, you don't need a license if you're fishing on a vessel that has a valid commercial fishing license.</p>

<h2>How Much Does a Saltwater Fishing License Cost?</h2>

<p>The cost of a saltwater fishing license in New Jersey depends on the type of license you need. A basic saltwater fishing license costs $10.50 for residents and $20.50 for non-residents. There are also more expensive licenses available that give you additional privileges and benefits.</p>

<h2>Where Can You Get a Saltwater Fishing License?</h2>

To purchase by phone, call the agency's toll-free number. Finally, you can purchase a license in person at any of the state's licensing agents.</p>
