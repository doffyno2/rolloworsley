<p>It can be a frightening experience when a dog hits its head hard, and it is important to know the symptoms of a head injury in a dog so that you can act quickly and get help if needed. While some head injuries may cause only minor problems, more severe head trauma can cause permanent damage or even death. Knowing the signs and symptoms of a head injury can help you determine when to seek veterinary care.</p>

<h2>Types of Head Trauma in Dogs</h2>

<p>Head trauma in dogs can be classified as either open or closed. Open head trauma occurs when a dog receives a penetrating wound due to a sharp object. This type of injury is usually caused by a dog being hit by a car or an object such as a rock or piece of furniture. Closed head trauma, on the other hand, is usually caused by a blunt object and can range from mild to severe. Common causes of closed head trauma include being hit by a car, being dropped or falling, and being hit by a large object such as a tree branch.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of a Head Injury in Dogs</h2>

<p>If your dog has suffered a head injury, it is important to watch for signs and symptoms that could indicate a more serious problem. Common signs of a head injury include:</p>

<ul>

<h2>Treatments for a Head Injury in Dogs</h2>

<p>The treatment for a head injury in a dog will depend on the severity of the injury. For mild head trauma, the most important thing is to provide your dog with supportive care.
