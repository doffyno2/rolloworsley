<p>Centipedes are a type of arthropod that are typically found in dark, damp environments like basements, cellars, and underneath rocks or logs. They can be found all over the world, including in the United States, and are known for their long, segmented bodies and various colorations. Centipedes have a pair of elongated mandibles, or jaws, which they use to capture and feed on their prey. Unfortunately, these same mandibles can be used to bite humans and animals, including dogs.</p>

<p>Centipede bites on dogs can cause a range of symptoms, depending on the size and type of centipede involved and the size and health of the dog. In most cases, centipede bites are painful and can cause swelling, redness, and occasionally itching. In some cases, the bite may become infected, leading to additional symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, and lethargy. In rare cases, a centipede bite on a dog can be fatal, though this is incredibly rare.</p>
