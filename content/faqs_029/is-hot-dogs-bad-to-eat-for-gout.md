Gout is a type of arthritis that affects more than 8 million people in the U.S. alone. It is a form of inflammatory arthritis that is caused by a buildup of uric acid in the joints. The most common symptom of gout is intense joint pain, usually in the big toe, but it can affect other joints as well. While there is no cure for gout, there are ways to manage the symptoms and prevent flare-ups. One of the most important things you can do is to watch what you eat. In particular, hot dogs are a common food that people wonder if they should avoid when they have gout. 

<h2>What Is Gout?</h2>

Gout is a form of arthritis that is caused by a buildup of uric acid in the body. Uric acid is a waste product that is produced when the body breaks down purines, which are naturally occurring substances found in some foods. When the body produces too much uric acid, it can become crystallized and deposit in the joints, causing inflammation and pain. 

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Gout?</h2>

<h2>Are There Any Other Foods to Avoid With Gout?</h2>

In general, it is best to limit or avoid foods that are high in purines. These include red meat, organ meats, shellfish, and certain types of fish, such as mackerel and anchovies. Alcohol, especially beer, can also worsen gout symptoms, so it is best to limit or avoid drinking alcohol if you have gout. 

<h2>Are There Any Foods That Can Help Relieve Gout?</h2>
