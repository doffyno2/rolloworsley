<p>Morrow Snowboards was a popular snowboard brand that was founded in 1988 and was based in Lake Tahoe, California. The company was known for its innovative designs, quality materials, and great customer service. However, in 2011, after 23 years of success, Morrow Snowboards abruptly closed its doors. So what happened to the beloved brand?</p>

<h2>The History of Morrow Snowboards</h2>

<p>Morrow Snowboards was founded in 1988 by brothers Rob and Randy Morrow, two snowboard enthusiasts who wanted to make the sport more accessible to all levels of riders. Their goal was to create high-quality boards that would offer superior performance and unparalleled durability. They achieved this goal with a combination of cutting-edge technology and innovative design. The company quickly became a leader in the snowboard industry and was the first to introduce a wide range of boards for all levels of riders, from beginners to pros.</p>

<p>Morrow Snowboards was also known for its commitment to customer service.

In addition, the company was dedicated to using the highest quality materials and construction techniques in order to ensure the best possible performance and durability. For this reason, Morrow Snowboards was well-respected in the industry and had a loyal following of customers.</p>

<h2>The Decline of Morrow Snowboards</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, in 2011, Morrow Snowboards abruptly closed its doors. There were several factors that contributed to the company's downfall, including the economic recession and the increasing popularity of other snowboard brands. Additionally, the company was facing increased competition from other snowboard manufacturers, such as Burton and K2, who were able to offer more advanced technology and designs at lower prices.</p>

<p>Moreover, the company was also affected by a decrease in the number of snowboarders in the United States. According to the National Ski Areas Association, the number of snowboarders in the US decreased from 8.9 million in 2009 to 8.2 million in 2011. This decrease can be attributed to the economic recession, which caused many people to cut back on recreational activities such as snowboarding.</p>
