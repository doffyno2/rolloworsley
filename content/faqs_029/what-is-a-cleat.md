What is a Cleat?

A cleat is a device used on the bottom of a shoe or boot to provide additional grip and stability on surfaces such as grass, mud, and dirt.

The use of cleats in sports began in the late 19th century, when they were used in soccer, baseball, and track and field.

<h2>Types of Cleats</h2>

Each type of cleat is designed to provide the best traction and stability on different surfaces and in different weather conditions. The most common types of cleats are baseball cleats, soccer cleats, football cleats, and lacrosse cleats. 

<h3>Baseball Cleats</h3>
