<p>Prison Architect is a highly popular construction and management simulation game, developed by Introversion Software. It allows players to build and manage their own maximum security prison, including designing and constructing buildings, dealing with inmates, hiring staff, and keeping their prisoners safe and secure. One of the most challenging aspects of the game is the construction of the prison itself - particularly the tunnels. Tunnels are often used to connect various parts of the prison in order to keep inmates from escaping, or to quickly move around the prison or transport supplies. However, they can also be difficult to manage and can create problems for the prison's staff.</p>

<p>In this article, we will discuss some tips and tricks for managing tunnels in Prison Architect, so that your prison runs as smoothly as possible. We will cover the basics of tunnel construction, as well as how to get rid of them when they are no longer needed.</p>

<h2>What are Tunnels?</h2>

<p>Tunnels are underground pathways that connect two points in a prison. They can be used to transport inmates, supplies, or other items between different parts of the prison. Tunnels can also be used to create escape routes or to hide contraband. Tunnels can be built using a variety of materials, including concrete, wood, and metal.</p>

<h2>How to Build Tunnels in Prison Architect</h2>

<p>Building tunnels in Prison Architect is relatively easy. The first step is to choose where you want to build the tunnel. You can build tunnels between the following locations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The entrance to the prison</li>
  <li>The entrance to the prison yard</li>
  <li>The entrance to the cells</li>
  <li>The entrance to the staff area</li>
  <li>The entrance to the guard station</li>
  <li>The entrance to the supply room</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have chosen the location, you will need to choose the materials for the tunnel. The materials used will depend on the purpose of the tunnel. For example, if the tunnel is being used to transport inmates, you will need to use a more durable material such as concrete or metal. If the tunnel is being used to hide contraband, you may want to use wood or other less durable materials.</p>

<p>Once you have chosen the location and materials, you will need to begin construction. You can use the "Tunnel" tool in the Construction tab of the game to begin building the tunnel. You will need to select a start and end point, as well as the width of the tunnel. Once you have finished building the tunnel, it will be ready for use.</p>

<h2>How to Get Rid of Tunnels in Prison Architect</h2>

<p>Once you have finished using a tunnel in Prison Architect, you will need to get rid of it. The process for getting rid of a tunnel is relatively simple. First, you will need to select the tunnel and then choose the "Demolish" option from the Construction tab. This will immediately remove the tunnel from your prison. However, the tunnel will still appear in the game's records and will still be counted towards your prison's budget.</p>

<h2>Other Tips for Managing Tunnels in Prison Architect</h2>

<p>In addition to building and getting rid of tunnels in Prison Architect, there are a few other tips and tricks you should keep in mind when managing tunnels. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure to place guards at key points along the tunnel to ensure that inmates do not attempt to escape.</li>
  <li>Keep the entrance to the tunnel well-lit, as this will make it easier for guards to spot any inmates attempting to use the tunnel.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the tunnel is wide enough to accommodate both inmates and supplies. This will help to prevent overcrowding.</li>
  <li>Keep the tunnel clean and well-maintained. This will help to prevent the spread of disease and other health hazards.</li>
</ul>
