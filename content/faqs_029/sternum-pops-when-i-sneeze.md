Sternum pops or pops in the chest when sneezing is a relatively common phenomenon. It is usually caused by a combination of factors, including abnormal heart rhythms, chest wall trauma, or an infection. In this article, we will take a deep dive into why sternum pops occur and what can be done to prevent it.

<h2>What Is a Sternum Pop?</h2>

A sternum pop is a sudden, loud popping sound that occurs in the chest when a person sneezes. It is not usually painful, but it can be a little disconcerting. The sound is caused by a combination of air pressure, chest wall movement, and muscle contractions.

<h2>What Causes Sternum Pops When I Sneeze?</h2>

Sternum pops when sneezing can be caused by a variety of factors. These include:

<h3>Abnormal Heart Rhythms</h3>

Abnormal heart rhythms can cause the heart to beat harder and faster, resulting in air pressure that is released with each beat. This air pressure can cause sternum pops when sneezing.

<h3>Chest Wall Trauma</h3>

Chest wall trauma can also cause sternum pops when sneezing. This trauma can be caused by a bad fall, a hard hit to the chest, or even a car accident. When the chest wall is injured, it can cause air to become trapped in the chest cavity, which can be released with a forceful sneeze.

<h3>Infection</h3>

Infections, such as the common cold, can also cause sternum pops when sneezing. When a person has a cold, their body is fighting off the infection by producing mucus. This mucus can become trapped in the chest cavity, and when a person sneezes, the trapped mucus can be released with a pop.

<h2>How Can I Prevent Sternum Pops When I Sneeze?</h2>

There are several things that a person can do to help prevent sternum pops when sneezing. These include:

<h3>Stay Hydrated</h3>

Staying hydrated helps to reduce mucus production and can help to reduce the chance of sternum pops when sneezing.

<h3>Avoid Excessive Exercise</h3>

Excessive exercise can cause air to become trapped in the chest, which can lead to sternum pops when sneezing. To help prevent this, it is important to take breaks during exercise and to avoid overexerting yourself.

<h3>See a Doctor If Necessary</h3>

If the sternum pops when sneezing become regular or frequent, it may be necessary to see a doctor. A doctor can diagnose the cause of the symptom and prescribe treatment if necessary.
