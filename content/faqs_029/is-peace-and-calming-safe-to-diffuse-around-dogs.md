The use of essential oils around pets can be a tricky subject. The use of essential oils with pets, especially dogs, is becoming increasingly popular as more pet owners are looking for natural remedies to help their pet's health and wellbeing. However, there are certain essential oils that are not safe to use around pets, and one of these is Peace and Calming. This article will take a closer look at the safety of Peace and Calming essential oil when diffused around dogs, as well as offer some tips for diffusing safely around pets.

<h2>What is Peace and Calming?</h2>

Peace and Calming is an essential oil blend created by Young Living Essential Oils. It is a blend of five different essential oils: tangerine, ylang ylang, patchouli, blue tansy, and orange. This blend is designed to help reduce stress and promote feelings of relaxation and peace. It is often used in aromatherapy to help reduce tension and stress, as well as to help promote a more restful sleep.

<h2>Is Peace and Calming Safe to Diffuse Around Dogs?</h2>

Peace and Calming is generally considered safe to diffuse around dogs, but there are some precautions that should be taken. The main concern with diffusing essential oils around pets is that some oils can be toxic to them. Ylang ylang and tangerine, two of the essential oils in the Peace and Calming blend, can be toxic to dogs if they are exposed to too much of the oil. It is important to always diffuse essential oils in a well-ventilated area and to not leave the diffuser running for long periods of time, as this can cause the oil to become too concentrated and potentially toxic. 

It is also important to note that some dogs may be more sensitive to essential oils than others. If your dog is particularly sensitive to smells and fragrances, it is best to avoid diffusing essential oils around them, as this could cause them distress or even cause a reaction.

<h2>Tips for Diffusing Essential Oils Around Dogs</h2>
