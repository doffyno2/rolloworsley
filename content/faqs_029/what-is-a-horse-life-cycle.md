<p>The life cycle of a horse is an amazing journey of growth, development and change. Horses are unique creatures, and each one has its own individual characteristics. The life cycle of a horse is divided into four distinct phases: foal, yearling, adult, and senior. Each phase is characterized by different physical and developmental milestones.</p>

<h2>Foal Phase: Birth to One Year</h2>

<p>The foal phase is the earliest stage of a horse’s life. It usually begins shortly after birth and lasts until the horse is one year old. During this time, the foal will grow rapidly and learn the basics of life. They will learn to walk, run, and interact with other horses and humans. Most foals will also receive basic training during this period.</p>

<p>At birth, the foal will already have the basic instincts needed to survive. This includes being able to stand, walk, and run within a few hours after being born. Foals will typically nurse for about four months and then begin to eat solid food. As the foal grows, it will become more independent and begin to explore its environment. At around six months, the foal will start to shed its baby coat and will be ready to begin basic training.</p>

<h2>Yearling Phase: One to Two Years Old</h2>

<p>The yearling phase is the second stage of a horse’s life cycle. This is the period when the horse starts to become an adult. During this time, the horse will continue to grow and develop physically and mentally. Most horses will reach their full adult height during this period.</p>

<p>In the yearling phase, the horse will begin to be trained for specific tasks. This includes learning how to respond to commands, being ridden, and competing in certain disciplines such as show jumping and dressage. During this period, the horse will also begin to develop its own personality and character.</p>

<h2>Adult Phase: Two to Twelve Years Old</h2>

<p>The adult phase is the third stage of a horse’s life cycle. During this period, the horse is fully grown and is capable of performing the tasks it was trained to do. This period is usually considered to be the most productive period of a horse’s life. During this time, a horse can compete in a variety of disciplines and can be used for a range of purposes.</p>

<p>In the adult phase, the horse’s personality and character will become more defined. The horse will also be able to learn more complex tasks and will be able to be ridden and trained more effectively. During this period, the horse will also be able to form strong bonds with its owners and trainers.</p>

<h2>Senior Phase: Twelve Years and Older</h2>

<p>The senior phase is the fourth and final stage of a horse’s life cycle. During this period, the horse is considered to be an older horse and its performance will begin to decline. Most horses will begin to show signs of aging, such as stiff joints and a decrease in energy levels. During this period, the horse may need to be retired from competition and will require special care.</p>

<p>In the senior phase, the horse will still be able to perform some of the tasks it was trained to do, but it may need to be handled with more care. During this period, the horse will also need to receive special care in order to maintain its health and wellbeing. This includes regular veterinary check-ups, proper nutrition, and adequate exercise.</p>
