Bacterial folliculitis is an infection of the skin caused by bacteria. It typically appears as a red, inflamed area on the skin that is filled with pus. Bacterial folliculitis can be uncomfortable and unsightly, but is usually not serious. It can be treated effectively with antibiotics and other therapies.

<h2>What is Bacterial Folliculitis?</h2>

Bacterial folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles caused by bacteria. It typically appears as red, inflamed areas on the skin that are filled with pus. It can occur anywhere on the body, but is most common on the face, neck, upper chest, back, and buttocks. Bacterial folliculitis is not contagious and does not spread from person to person.

<h2>What Causes Bacterial Folliculitis?</h2>

Bacterial folliculitis is caused by bacteria that normally lives on the skin. When the skin is damaged, such as from a cut, scrape, or burn, the bacteria can enter the hair follicles and cause an infection. Other factors that can increase the risk of bacterial folliculitis include excessive sweating, tight-fitting clothing, and poor hygiene.

<h2>Who is at Risk for Bacterial Folliculitis?</h2>

Anyone can develop bacterial folliculitis, but people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV or cancer, are more likely to develop the condition. People who shave their face or body, or who use topical steroid creams, are also at increased risk.

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Bacterial Folliculitis?</h2>

The primary symptom of bacterial folliculitis is a red, inflamed area on the skin that is filled with pus. This area may be painful, itchy, and tender when touched. Other symptoms may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, and a white or yellow discharge from the affected area.

<h2>How is Bacterial Folliculitis Diagnosed?</h2>

Your doctor may diagnose bacterial folliculitis based on a physical examination and your medical history. Your doctor may also take a sample of the pus and send it to a laboratory for testing. This can help confirm the diagnosis and help your doctor determine the best course of treatment.

<h2>How is Bacterial Folliculitis Treated?</h2>

Bacterial folliculitis is usually treated with antibiotics, such as cephalexin or clindamycin. These antibiotics are taken orally or applied topically to the affected area. Antifungal creams may also be prescribed to help reduce the inflammation. In some cases, your doctor may recommend that you stop shaving for a few weeks to allow the infection to heal.

<h2>Can Bacterial Folliculitis Be Prevented?</h2>

The best way to prevent bacterial folliculitis is to practice good skin care. This includes washing the skin regularly with mild soap and water, avoiding tight-fitting clothing, and avoiding excessive sweating. If you shave, make sure to use a clean razor and use a shaving cream or gel to help prevent irritation.
