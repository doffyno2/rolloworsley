However, for many new players, figuring out how to walk in BDO can be a bit confusing at first. In this article, we'll explain how to walk in BDO, as well as some tips on how to get around the game more quickly and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Understanding the BDO Movement System</h2>

<p>When you start playing BDO, the first thing you'll want to do is learn how to move around the game world. The game uses a combination of the WASD keys and the mouse to move your character. To walk forward, press the W key on your keyboard. To move backward, press the S key. To turn left or right, press the A and D keys, respectively. You can also turn your character by moving the mouse around.</p>

<p>In addition to the WASD controls, you can also use the left and right mouse buttons to move your character. If you click the left mouse button, your character will move forward. If you click the right mouse button, your character will move backward. You can also hold down the left or right mouse button and move the mouse around to turn your character in that direction.</p>

<h2>How to Sprint in BDO</h2>

<p>If you want to get around the game world faster, you can use the sprint feature. To sprint, press the left shift key on your keyboard. This will make your character run faster than normal. You can also use the left and right mouse buttons to move faster. If you click and hold down the left mouse button, your character will begin to sprint. If you click and hold down the right mouse button, your character will move backward while sprinting.</p>
