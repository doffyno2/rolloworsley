<p>In the wild, dogs are natural scavengers, and they love to chew on bones and antlers. Deer antlers, in particular, make great chew toys for dogs. However, they can be hard and sharp, which can make them dangerous for your pet. If you want to give your pup a safe antler to chew on, you'll need to soften it first. Here's how you can do it.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Boil the Antler</h2>

<p>The first step to softening a deer antler is to boil it. Boiling the antler will help to reduce the hardness, as well as any bacteria or dirt that may be present. Put the antler in a pot of boiling water and let it boil for 10-15 minutes. Once it's done, remove it from the pot and let it cool.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Soak the Antler</h2>

<p>Once the antler has cooled, it's time to soak it. Fill a container with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap. Place the antler in the container and let it soak for at least an hour. The soap will help to soften the antler further, as well as help to remove any remaining dirt or bacteria.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Scrub the Antler</h2>

<p>Once the antler has been soaked, it's time to give it a good scrub. Using a soft brush, gently scrub the antler to remove any remaining dirt or bacteria. Be sure to rinse it thoroughly to remove any soap residue.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Dry the Antler</h2>

<p>Once the antler has been scrubbed, it's time to dry it. Place the antler on a towel and let it air dry. Once it's dry, it's ready for your pup to enjoy!</p>
