While cooked halibut is generally considered to be safe for dogs, it's important to be aware of the potential risks associated with feeding your dog this type of fish. This includes potential risks related to contaminants, such as mercury and other heavy metals, as well as potential digestive issues.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Halibut for Dogs</h2>
