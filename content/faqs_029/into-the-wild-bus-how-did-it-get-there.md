<p>In the summer of 1992, a decommissioned school bus was discovered in the Alaskan wilderness, miles away from any roads or settlements. It was quickly dubbed the “Into the Wild Bus”, a reference to the popular book and movie of the same name which chronicled the true story of Christopher McCandless, a young man who had ventured into the Alaskan wilderness in search of adventure. The mysterious bus has become a popular tourist attraction, and its story has been the subject of much speculation.</p>

<p>The most popular version of the story is that the bus was brought into the Alaskan wilderness by an engineer and trapper by the name of Earl Pilgrim. Pilgrim had lived in Alaska for more than ten years, and was an avid hunter and outdoorsman. He had a habit of taking buses and other vehicles into the wilderness, and the Into the Wild Bus was one of his projects. According to Pilgrim, he had purchased the bus in Fairbanks and driven it to the Stampede Trail, where it was abandoned. He claimed that he had done so in order to provide shelter for hunters and trappers in the area, and that he had no idea that the bus would become so popular.</p>

<p>While Pilgrim's story is the most popular version of the bus's origin, it is not the only one. Some have argued that the bus was brought into the wilderness by the US military in the 1950s, as part of a Cold War-era psychological warfare experiment. Others have suggested that it was brought in by a group of hippies in the 1960s. Still others have argued that it was brought in by a group of trappers in the 1970s. Whatever its origin, the Into the Wild Bus has become an iconic symbol of Alaska, and a reminder of the spirit of adventure and exploration.</p>
