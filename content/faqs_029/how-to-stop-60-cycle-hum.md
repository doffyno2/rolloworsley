<p>60 cycle hum is a common problem in audio equipment. It is caused by a voltage fluctuation in the power source, and is most noticeable when sound is amplified. This can be a huge annoyance and can interfere with your enjoyment of your music. Thankfully, there are many ways to stop 60 cycle hum and keep your audio equipment humming along without any problems.</p>

<h2>What is 60 Cycle Hum?</h2>

<p>60 cycle hum is a low-frequency hum caused by a fluctuation in the power source. This fluctuation occurs due to the alternating current used in most electrical systems. The frequency of the hum is usually around 60 Hz, but it can also occur at other frequencies. In audio equipment, the hum can be heard through speakers or headphones, and is usually most noticeable when the equipment is amplified.</p>

<h2>What Causes 60 Cycle Hum?</h2>

<p>60 cycle hum is caused by a voltage fluctuation in the power source. This can be due to a faulty electrical connection, or a problem with the power source itself. It can also be caused by interference from other electrical appliances or power lines. In some cases, it can be caused by a faulty component in the audio equipment itself.</p>

<h2>How to Diagnose the Problem</h2>

<p>In order to diagnose the source of the 60 cycle hum, it's important to first identify where the hum is coming from. If the hum is coming from the speakers or headphones, it's likely a problem with the audio equipment itself. If the hum is coming from the power source, it's likely due to a faulty electrical connection or a problem with the power source itself.</p>

<h2>How to Stop 60 Cycle Hum</h2>

<p>Once the source of the 60 cycle hum has been identified, there are several steps you can take to stop it. If the hum is coming from the power source, the first step is to check all electrical connections for loose or damaged wiring. If the wiring looks fine, it's recommended to replace the power source with a new one. If the hum is coming from the audio equipment itself, it's recommended to replace any faulty components and check all connections for tightness.</p>

<h2>How to Reduce the Effects of 60 Cycle Hum</h2>

<p>Even if you can't completely stop the 60 cycle hum, there are several ways to reduce its effects. One way is to use a power conditioner, which helps to regulate the voltage of the power source and reduce the hum. Another way is to use a ground loop isolator, which helps to reduce the hum by isolating the ground potential between two pieces of equipment. Finally, using shielded cables can also help to reduce the hum.</p>

<h2>Preventing Future Problems</h2>

<p>In order to prevent future problems with 60 cycle hum, it's important to take steps to ensure that your audio equipment is properly connected and maintained. Make sure all wiring is secure, and inspect all connections for wear and tear. If you're using power conditioners or ground loop isolators, make sure they are installed correctly and are functioning properly. Finally, ensure that all cables are properly shielded and are not in contact with any other power lines.</p>
