<h2>What is the Maintenance Light?</h2>

<p>The maintenance light on your Toyota Prius 2015 is a reminder that it’s time to perform routine maintenance on your vehicle. This may include checking tire pressure, oil levels, brake fluid, and other important components. When you’ve completed the maintenance, the light will turn off automatically. However, if you’d like to turn it off manually, you can do so with a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>Steps for Turning Off Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>The first step in turning off the maintenance light is to locate the vehicle’s on-board diagnostics (OBD) port, which is usually located under the dashboard. The port is usually labeled “OBD” or “OBD II.”</p>

<h3>Step 2: Connect the OBD Scanner</h3>

<h3>Step 3: Turn On the Scanner</h3>

<p>Once the scanner is connected, turn it on and wait for the OBD system to initialize. This may take a few minutes.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Select the Appropriate Mode</h3>

<p>Once the OBD system is initialized, select the appropriate mode for the maintenance light. The options may vary depending on your specific vehicle, but they typically include “Maintenance,” “Reset,” or “Clear.”</p>

<h3>Step 5: Confirm the Reset</h3>
