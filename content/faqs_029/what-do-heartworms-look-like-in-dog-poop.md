Heartworms are parasites that can infect your canine companion, and if left untreated, can cause serious and potentially fatal illness. Most people are familiar with the classic symptoms of heartworm infection – coughing, fatigue, and difficulty breathing – but many don’t know that it can also manifest in a less obvious form: visible worms in your pup’s feces. If you’ve seen worms in your dog’s poop and are worried that they might be heartworms, here’s what you need to know.

<h2>What Are Heartworms?</h2>

Heartworms are parasitic worms that are transmitted by mosquitoes. Infected mosquitoes pass larvae to your dog through a bite, and the larvae grow into adult worms over the course of several months. The adult worms then settle in your pup’s heart and lungs and begin to reproduce, resulting in a full-fledged infestation.

<h2>The Symptoms of Heartworm Disease</h2>

The symptoms of heartworm disease can vary from dog to dog, but the most common signs include coughing, difficulty breathing, fatigue, and decreased appetite. In some cases, the worms can be seen in your pup’s vomit or feces. If left untreated, the worms can cause serious and potentially fatal illness.

<h2>What Do Heartworms Look Like in Dog Poop?</h2>

Heartworms are long, thin worms that can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. In dog poop, they typically appear white or pale yellow and may be coiled or straight. The worms can sometimes be seen wiggling around in your pup’s feces, but they are often hidden in the stool and may only be visible when your pup strains to defecate.

<h2>Should You Be Concerned About Seeing Heartworms in Dog Poop?</h2>

Seeing worms in your pup’s poop can be alarming, but it’s important to remember that not all worms are heartworms. Roundworms and tapeworms, for example, are relatively common parasites that can be found in canine feces. If you’re concerned that your pup may have heartworms, it’s best to take him to the vet for a checkup.

<h2>How Can You Prevent Heartworm Disease?</h2>

The best way to protect your pup from heartworm disease is to make sure he is on a regular preventive medication. These medications are usually administered orally or topically and help to kill the larvae before they can grow into adult worms. Additionally, it’s important to make sure your pup is up to date on his vaccinations and to speak with your vet about the best way to protect your pup from mosquitoes.
