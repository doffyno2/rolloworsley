<p>Are you looking to make a TSA Precheck appointment but aren’t sure what documents you need to bring? Taking the time to get TSA Precheck is a great way to streamline your airport security process and save time waiting in line. But, before you can enjoy the benefits of TSA Precheck, you will need to bring some documents with you to your appointment.</p>

<h2>What Is TSA Precheck?</h2>

<p>TSA Precheck is a program that allows you to move through airport security quickly, without the need to remove your shoes, laptops, liquids, belts, and light jackets. To be eligible for TSA Precheck, you must submit an application and be an American citizen, permanent resident, or a citizen of a participating country. Additionally, you must pass a background check and have your fingerprints taken at an appointment.</p>

<h2>What Documents Do I Need for a TSA Precheck Appointment?</h2>

<p>When you arrive for your appointment, you must bring several documents with you. The following documents are required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A valid, government-issued photo ID, such as a driver’s license or passport.</li>
  <li>A completed TSA Precheck application, which can be found online.</li>
  <li>Proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate, naturalization certificate, or valid foreign passport.</li>
  <li>The payment for the application fee, which is typically $85.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that some applicants may be required to provide additional documentation, such as proof of military service, police records, or documents related to their immigration status.</p>

<h2>What Happens at the Appointment?</h2>

<p>At the appointment, you will provide your documents to the TSA agent and have your fingerprints taken. You will also be required to provide a valid form of payment for the application fee. Once your application has been approved and your background check has been completed, you will be issued a Known Traveler Number (KTN). This number will be used when booking flights and can be found on the back of your government-issued ID.</p>

<h2>What If My Application Is Denied?</h2>

<p>If your application is denied, you will be notified in writing. You can appeal the decision by submitting a written request to the Department of Homeland Security. It is important to note that the appeals process can take several months, so it is best to ensure that all documentation is complete before submitting your application.</p>

<h2>How Long Is My TSA Precheck Valid For?</h2>

<p>Once your application has been approved, your TSA Precheck is valid for a period of five years. However, your access to the program may be revoked or suspended if you are found to have violated any of the TSA’s security policies.</p>
