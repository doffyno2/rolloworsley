Cobras are a type of venomous snake found throughout the world. They are known for their distinctive hoods and their highly toxic venom, which can be fatal to humans and other animals. Cobras are also highly adaptable and can survive in a variety of habitats, from rainforest to deserts. Understanding the life cycle of a cobra is key to appreciating their special biology and behavior.

<h2>Cobra Egg Laying and Reproduction</h2>

Cobras lay eggs in order to reproduce. Depending on the species, cobras may lay anywhere from 5 to 60 eggs at a time. The eggs are usually laid in a shallow nest, which is typically hidden among rocks or vegetation. Once the eggs are laid, the female cobra will remain with them until they hatch, which typically takes around two months.

<h2>Cobra Hatching and Growth</h2>

Once the eggs hatch, the female cobra will leave the nest and the baby cobras will be on their own. Baby cobras, known as neonates, are born with a protective layer of skin which they shed soon after hatching. This skin helps to protect them from predators and the elements.

Cobras grow rapidly, and are able to eat small prey items such as rodents, lizards, and frogs shortly after hatching. They will molt their skin several times as they grow, shedding their old skin and revealing a larger and stronger cobra beneath.

<h2>Cobra Maturation</h2>

Once the cobra reaches adulthood, it will be fully mature and ready to reproduce. Females reach maturity at around two to three years of age, while males reach maturity at around three to four years of age. Mature cobras can live for up to 20 years in the wild.
