Mountain biking is a sport that requires a lot of technical knowledge and skill. Ensuring your bike is set up correctly with the right components is essential for an enjoyable and safe ride. One of the most important components for any mountain bike is the hub. Knowing the boost hub measurement for mountain bikes is essential for any mountain biker.

<h2>What is Boost Hub Measurement?</h2>

Boost hub measurement is the standard measurement of a mountain bike’s rear hub width. Boost hub measurement is referred to as the “Boost Standard”. The Boost standard was created to ensure that all mountain bike components are the same size and compatible with one another. Boost hub measurement is measured in millimeters and is usually a multiple of 10mm. The most common Boost hub measurements range from 110mm to 148mm.

<h2>What is the Difference Between Boost Hub Measurement and Non-Boost Hub Measurement?</h2>

The main difference between Boost hub measurement and non-Boost hub measurement is the width of the hub. Boost hubs are designed to be wider than non-Boost hubs. This means that Boost hubs are able to accommodate larger tires, which in turn increases the overall stability of the bike. Boost hubs also have a more symmetrical flange spacing than non-Boost hubs, which improves spoke tension and wheel strength.

<h2>Which Bikes are Compatible With Boost Hubs?</h2>

Boost hubs are most commonly found on mountain bikes, but they are also compatible with some road bikes and cyclocross bikes. Boost hubs are designed for use with 27.5 inch and 29 inch wheels, although some are compatible with 26 inch wheels. Boost hubs come in both front and rear varieties, depending on the type of bike.

<h2>How Do You Determine the Boost Hub Measurement of Your Mountain Bike?</h2>

To determine the Boost hub measurement of your mountain bike, first measure the width of your rear hub. The Boost hub measurement is usually printed on the hub in millimeters, but if it is not then you can measure it with a ruler. Once you have the measurement, divide it by 10 to get the Boost hub measurement. For example, if your rear hub measures 135mm then the Boost hub measurement is 13.5.

<h2>What Parts Are Compatible With Boost Hubs?</h2>

When buying components for your mountain bike, it is important to make sure they are compatible with your Boost hub measurement. Wheels, hubs, frames, and forks are all available in Boost-compatible sizes. Many aftermarket components, such as handlebars and stems, are also available in Boost-compatible sizes.

<h2>Are Boost Hubs Worth It?</h2>

Boost hubs are generally more expensive than non-Boost hubs, but they offer many benefits. The wider hub width allows for larger tires and improved wheel strength. The more symmetrical flange spacing also helps to improve spoke tension and wheel strength. For mountain bikers looking for improved wheel strength and stability, Boost hubs are worth the extra cost.
