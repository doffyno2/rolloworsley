<p>The practice of pilgrimage has been an important part of the faith of many people and cultures for thousands of years. The act of pilgrimage involves journeying to a holy site and participating in a spiritual process of contemplation, reflection and renewal. In England, pilgrimages have been a part of the culture for centuries. Each year, thousands of pilgrims make their way to a variety of holy sites, often with the goal of seeking spiritual solace and guidance. But when do these pilgrims traditionally set off on their journeys?</p>

<h2>The History of English Pilgrimage</h2>

<p>The origins of English pilgrimage can be traced back to the medieval period, when the Church was a powerful force in the country. Pilgrimage was seen as an important way to demonstrate one's faith and devotion to the Church, and it was often used as a way of seeking divine intervention in matters of health, wealth, and justice. Pilgrims would travel to shrines dedicated to particular saints or martyrs, often making a vow to visit the site in exchange for a favor or blessing. While these journeys often took place throughout the year, there was a certain time of year that was seen as the most auspicious for pilgrimages to take place.</p>

<h2>When Do Most English Pilgrims Set Off On Pilgrimages?</h2>

<p>The traditional time for English pilgrims to set off on their journeys is the month of May. May was seen as an auspicious month by medieval Christians as it was the time of the Pentecost, the Christian feast day that commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the Apostles. It was also the time of the May festival, a pagan celebration of fertility and rebirth that was adopted by the early Church. Thus, May was seen as a time of renewal, hope, and spiritual progress, making it an ideal time for pilgrims to embark on their journeys.</p>

<p>The month of May also coincided with the traditional “Gang Days”, a period when people would go out in large groups on various errands and journeys. It was a time for people to work together and embark on new adventures, which made it the perfect time for pilgrims to set off on their pilgrimages. In addition, the traditional Gang Days coincided with the beginning of the warmer weather, which was ideal for travel.</p>

<h2>Modern English Pilgrimages</h2>

<p>Today, the month of May is still seen as a traditional time for English pilgrims to set off on their journeys. However, due to the growing popularity of pilgrimage as a spiritual practice, pilgrims now often choose to depart throughout the year. Many pilgrims still choose to make their journeys in May, as it is seen as a time of spiritual renewal and progress, but there is no longer a strict requirement to do so.</p>

<p>In addition, modern pilgrims are often more likely to set off on shorter journeys than their medieval counterparts, often choosing to visit a single holy site for a day trip or weekend getaway. While the traditional pilgrimage was an extended journey, often taking several weeks or even months, modern pilgrims are often more likely to take shorter trips. This makes it easier for them to fit their pilgrimage into their other commitments, such as work and family.</p>
