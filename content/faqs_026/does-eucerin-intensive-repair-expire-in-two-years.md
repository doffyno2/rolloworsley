<h2>What is Eucerin Intensive Repair Cream?</h2>

Eucerin Intensive Repair Cream is a moisturizing cream designed to address the needs of dry, rough skin. The product features a combination of natural oils, waxes, and emollients to help soothe and lock in moisture. It is also formulated with Pro-Vitamin B5, which is known to help repair the skin's natural barrier, as well as Vitamin E, which helps protect against free radicals.

<h2>How Do I Know When My Eucerin Intensive Repair Cream Was Manufactured?</h2>

Eucerin Intensive Repair Cream is marked with a “best used before” date on the product packaging.
