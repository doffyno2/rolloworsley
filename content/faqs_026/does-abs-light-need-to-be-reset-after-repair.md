<p>The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) is an important safety feature in cars and other vehicles. It helps prevent skidding and wheel lockup when you press the brake pedal hard. ABS is designed to work in conjunction with the other braking systems in your car, such as the regular brakes and traction control. But if the ABS is not working properly, it can cause your car to skid and can even cause an accident. So, it's important to make sure that the ABS is functioning properly at all times.</p>

<p>When it comes to the ABS system, many people are unsure of whether or not they need to reset it after a repair. The answer is that it depends on the type of repair that was done. Generally speaking, certain types of repairs may require the ABS system to be reset, while others do not. This article will discuss the types of repairs that require an ABS reset and how to properly reset the system.</p>
