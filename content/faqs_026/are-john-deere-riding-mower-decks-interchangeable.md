<h2>Types of Decks</h2>

Fabricated steel decks are made from multiple pieces of steel that are welded together to form a single deck. While both types of decks are strong and durable, they are not interchangeable. Each type of deck requires different parts and accessories that are not compatible with the other.</p>

Once you have determined the type of deck you have, you can then purchase the appropriate replacement parts. It is important to note that the decks are not interchangeable, so you must purchase the correct parts for your particular mower.</p>

The decks are designed to work with specific parts and accessories, and modifying them can lead to serious problems. If you do choose to modify a deck, it is important to be aware of the risks and to follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.</p>
