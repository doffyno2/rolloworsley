<p>Cycling shorts are an essential part of a cyclist’s wardrobe. The right shorts will help you stay comfortable, reduce chafing and make your ride more enjoyable. But what about wearing shorts over cycling shorts? Is it something you should do?</p>

<p>The answer depends on the type of cycling you’re doing. If you’re doing a long-distance ride, then wearing shorts over your cycling shorts is a great idea. The extra layer will help protect your skin from the wind and keep you warmer on cold days. And if you’re worried about modesty, you can find cycling shorts with an integrated short to offer a little more coverage.</p>

<p>However, if you’re just doing a short ride or a quick spin around the block, then wearing shorts over your cycling shorts may not be necessary. The extra layer could end up making you too hot, and it could cause your shorts to bunch up and become uncomfortable. In that case, it’s best to just wear your cycling shorts.</p>

<p>That said, there are some situations where wearing shorts over cycling shorts makes sense. For example, if you’re riding in a wet, muddy area, the extra layer of shorts will help keep your cycling shorts dry and clean. And if you’re riding in cold temperatures, the extra layer can help keep you warmer. In any case, make sure to choose shorts that are comfortable, breathable and have a good fit.</p>

<p>So, when it comes to wearing shorts over cycling shorts, it really depends on the type of ride you’re doing and the weather conditions. If you’re going for a long ride in cold weather, then wearing shorts over your cycling shorts can be a good idea. But if you’re doing a shorter ride in warm weather, then you may not need the extra layer.</p>
