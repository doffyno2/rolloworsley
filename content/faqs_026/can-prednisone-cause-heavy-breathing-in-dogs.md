<p>Dogs are beloved family members, and like any other family member, they sometimes get sick or experience health problems. One of the most common medications prescribed to dogs is prednisone, a steroid that helps reduce inflammation and treat a variety of ailments. But prednisone can also have side effects, including heavy breathing in dogs. In this article, we'll cover what you need to know about prednisone and heavy breathing in dogs.</p>

It is available in several forms, including tablets, capsules, liquids, and injections.</p>

<h2>How Does Prednisone Work?</h2>

<p>Prednisone works by mimicking the action of cortisol, a hormone naturally produced by the body. It acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, which helps reduce swelling and pain in the affected area.

<h2>How Can Heavy Breathing be Treated?</h2>

<p>If your dog is experiencing heavy breathing due to prednisone, it is important to speak with your veterinarian. They can determine the best course of action to take to reduce the symptoms.
