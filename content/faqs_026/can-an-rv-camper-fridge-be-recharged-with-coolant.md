<p>RV camper fridges are a great way to keep food and drinks cool while camping. However, like any other type of appliance, they can go wrong from time to time and require some maintenance and repairs. One common issue is that the fridge may need to be recharged with coolant. This can be a tricky process as it involves working with hazardous chemicals – so it’s important to know how to do it safely and correctly.</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll explain how to safely recharge a RV camper fridge with coolant, and what tools and supplies you’ll need. We’ll also discuss the importance of regular maintenance and how to spot signs that your RV camper fridge needs to be recharged.</p>

<h2>What Is a RV Camper Fridge?</h2>

<p>A RV camper fridge is a small portable refrigerator, typically found in recreational vehicles (RVs). It’s designed to keep food and drinks cool while camping, and it can also be used as an extra fridge at home. RV camper fridges are powered by either gas or electricity, and they generally have a capacitance of around 3.5 to 5 cubic feet.</p>

<p>RV camper fridges are usually self-contained, meaning they don’t require any external cooling system. Instead, they rely on a refrigerant, usually a mixture of propane and butane, to provide cooling. This refrigerant is stored in an internal reservoir, and it needs to be regularly recharged in order to keep the fridge functioning properly.</p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies</h2>

<p>Before attempting to recharge your RV camper fridge with coolant, make sure you have all the necessary tools and supplies. You’ll need:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Safety glasses</li>
	<li>Gloves</li>
	<li>A coolant refill kit</li>
	<li>A funnel</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s also important to read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully before attempting to recharge your RV camper fridge. This will ensure that you’re using the correct coolant and that you’re following all safety precautions.</p>

<h2>Recharging Procedure</h2>

<p>Once you have all the necessary tools and supplies, you can begin the recharging procedure. The process can vary slightly depending on the type of RV camper fridge you have, so refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for specific instructions.</p>

<p>In general, however, the procedure involves the following steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Turn off the power to the RV camper fridge and unplug it from the power outlet.</li>
	<li>Locate the coolant reservoir and remove the cap.</li>
	<li>Put on safety glasses and gloves before handling the coolant.</li>
	<li>Using the funnel, fill the coolant reservoir with the coolant from the refill kit.</li>
	<li>Replace the cap and turn on the power to the RV camper fridge.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s important to note that the coolant can be hazardous, so make sure you take all necessary safety precautions when handling it. Additionally, some coolants may require you to mix them with water before filling the reservoir – so make sure you read the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.</p>
