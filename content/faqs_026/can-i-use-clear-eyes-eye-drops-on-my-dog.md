<p>Eye drops are an essential part of many pet owners’ toolbox for providing relief for their dog or cat’s eyes. But can you use human eye drops, such as Clear Eyes, on your pet?</p>

These eye drops are formulated for human eyes, not canine or feline eyes. What’s more, they contain ingredients that could be toxic to your pet. For example, Clear Eyes contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride, which is toxic to cats.</p>

<p>If your pet’s eyes are irritated or they’re showing signs of infection, it’s best to take them to your veterinarian. Your vet can examine your pet’s eyes to determine the cause of the problem and then prescribe eye drops or ointment that are safe for your pet.</p>
