A business cycle is a regular, recurrent cycle of economic fluctuations consisting of periods of expansion and contraction in an economy. It is an integral part of the economic system, and understanding it can help businesses to plan for the future. The business cycle is an important concept in economics and describes the natural fluctuations of an economy over a period of time. The business cycle is made up of four distinct phases: Expansion, Peak, Contraction and Recession.

<h2> Expansion </h2>

The expansion phase of the business cycle is when the economy begins to grow and is characterized by increased economic activity, increased employment, increased consumer spending and higher production. This is usually the most prosperous phase of the business cycle as businesses are able to take advantage of the increased demand for their goods and services. This phase is typically accompanied by low inflation and rising wages.

<h2> Peak </h2>

During this phase, the demand for goods and services is at its highest and businesses are able to take advantage of the increased demand. This phase is typically accompanied by higher inflation and wages.

<h2> Contraction </h2>

The contraction phase of the business cycle is when the economy begins to slow down and is characterized by decreased economic activity, decreased consumer spending, decreased production and higher unemployment. This phase is typically accompanied by high inflation and falling wages.

<h2> Recession </h2>

The recession phase of the business cycle is when the economy is at its lowest point and is characterized by decreased economic activity, decreased consumer spending, decreased production and high unemployment. This phase is typically accompanied by high inflation and falling wages.
