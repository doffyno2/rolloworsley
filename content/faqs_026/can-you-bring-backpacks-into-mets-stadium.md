<p>The New York Mets is a professional baseball team based in Queens, New York City, and they play their home games at Citi Field, which is located in the Flushing Meadows Corona Park. Every year, thousands of people flock to Citi Field to watch the Mets play, and many of them bring backpacks with them to the stadium. So the big question is: Can you bring backpacks into Mets Stadium?</p>

<p>The short answer is yes - you are allowed to bring backpacks into Citi Field. However, there are some restrictions in place to ensure the safety of all guests. All backpacks and bags must be no larger than 16”x16”x8” and must be searched upon entry. This search is done by security guards at the gates, and all guests must comply with the request. Any backpacks larger than the specified size will not be allowed into the stadium.</p>

<p>In addition to the size restriction, the Mets have also implemented a clear bag policy. All bags must be clear, and any bags that are not clear will not be allowed into the stadium. This policy is in place to ensure that all guests are able to enter the stadium as quickly and safely as possible. The only exception to this policy is for medical necessity bags, which can be brought into the stadium without being searched.</p>

All bags are subject to search upon entry, and if any of these prohibited items are found, they will be confiscated and not returned. It is also important to note that the Mets do not allow any re-entry into Citi Field. This means that if you leave the stadium, you will not be allowed to re-enter.</p>
