Are Humans More Closely Related to Dogs or Cats?


Humans and animals share an ancient and complex relationship. For thousands of years, animals have been domesticated, loved, and even worshiped. But of all the animals with which humans share a bond, none are more beloved or more closely related than the dog and the cat. 

But which of these two species is most closely related to humans? While both cats and dogs have been domesticated and long-lived companions to humankind, the answer to this question may surprise you.

<h2>How Humans Domesticated Dogs and Cats</h2>

Humans have had a relationship with both cats and dogs since ancient times. The domestication of cats is believed to have begun in the Middle East during the Neolithic period, about 10,000 years ago. Cats were domesticated for their ability to hunt and kill vermin, like rats and mice, and have since been kept as pets, guard animals, and even worshiped as gods.

Dogs, on the other hand, were first domesticated about 15,000 years ago. They were initially kept for their ability to hunt and guard humans and their settlements. Over time, dogs have also been kept as pets, used for hunting and sporting activities, and used in military and police operations.

<h2>The Science Behind the Relationship Between Humans and Dogs and Cats</h2>

The scientific evidence suggests that humans are more closely related to dogs than cats. Research has shown that both cats and dogs share similar genetic markers with humans, but the genetic markers in dogs are more closely related to those in humans than those found in cats.

Additionally, studies have shown that dogs and humans share similar behaviors and communication styles. Dogs, for instance, can recognize human facial expressions and respond accordingly, while cats tend to be more aloof and less responsive to human interaction. Dogs also understand human language and commands better than cats, and they have been shown to develop stronger bonds with humans than cats.

<h2>The Benefits of Keeping Dogs and Cats as Pets</h2>

The benefits of keeping both cats and dogs as pets are numerous. Both species provide companionship, affection, and unconditional love. Dogs and cats can also help reduce stress and anxiety levels in humans, as well as provide a sense of security.

Dogs, in particular, can be used for a variety of activities like fetching, walking, and jogging. They can also be trained to assist people with disabilities and provide emotional support to those who are ill or elderly. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent and can provide companionship without requiring as much attention as dogs.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The relationship between humans and animals is complex and fascinating. While cats and dogs have both been domesticated for thousands of years and are beloved by humans, the evidence suggests that humans are more closely related to dogs than cats. Dogs share similar genetic markers with humans, are more responsive to human interaction, and can be trained for a variety of activities. Cats, on the other hand, are more independent and require less attention from humans. Regardless of which species you choose, however, both cats and dogs provide unconditional love and companionship.
