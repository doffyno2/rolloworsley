<p>Oscar fish, also known by its scientific name Astronotus ocellatus, are a popular species of cichlid fish. They are native to the Amazon basin in South America, and they have become a popular fish to keep in home aquariums.

<p>Oscars are omnivorous, meaning they eat both plant and animal matter. In the wild, they eat a variety of foods including worms, crustaceans, snails, insects, and plant material. In home aquariums, they are typically fed a diet of commercial foods designed for cichlids, but some owners may choose to supplement their diet with live foods such as mealworms.</p>
