Teamfight Tactics (TFT) is a game mode within Riot Games’ popular game, League of Legends. It combines elements of traditional RPG-style gaming with a unique, strategic approach to team-based battles. Players take control of a team of powerful champions and use their abilities to fight against other players in intense, fast-paced rounds of combat.

In TFT, players have the option of climbing the ranked ladder, in which they have to prove their skills against players from around the world. In this article, we’ll discuss what climbing the ranked ladder in TFT entails and how it can help improve your game.
