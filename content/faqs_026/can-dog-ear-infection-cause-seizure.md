This type of infection is caused by bacteria, fungus, or yeast, and can be very painful for the dog.

All of these types of ear infections can cause seizures in dogs.</p>

<p>The symptoms of an ear infection in dogs can vary depending on the type of infection and its severity.

If the infection is severe, a dog may also experience fever, loss of appetite, and difficulty hearing.</p>

<h2>Can Ear Infections Cause Seizures?</h2>

Regularly cleaning your dog's ears with a veterinarian-approved cleaner can help keep their ears healthy and reduce their risk of infection.
