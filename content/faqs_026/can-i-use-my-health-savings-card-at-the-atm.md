<p>The other limitation is that you cannot use your HSA card at any ATM. You can only use your HSA card at ATMs that are affiliated with your HSA provider.

To withdraw funds from your HSA, you must submit a request to your HSA provider. The HSA provider will then process the request and send you a check for the amount you requested.</p>

You can use your HSA card to pay for qualified medical expenses at any location that accepts major credit cards.
