<p>Car accidents happen all the time, and it’s no surprise that auto body shops are often called upon to repair the damage. But when it comes to filing insurance claims, many people are left wondering if auto body shops report repair to insurance. The good news is that in most cases, the answer is yes.</p>

<p>When an auto body shop is called upon to repair a vehicle, they often need to file a claim with the insurance company in order to get the repair costs covered.

This report will include details such as the cost of the repair, the parts used, and the time it took to complete the repair.</p>

<p>There are some cases where auto body shops may not report repair to insurance. This is usually because the repair costs are not high enough to justify filing a claim.
