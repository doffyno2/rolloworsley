Pooping is an essential part of life, so it’s natural to want to know why your eyes water when you’re doing your business. While there are a few potential causes, the most common is a condition called lacrimation. Also known as “watery eyes,” lacrimation is a type of eye irritation that can lead to uncomfortable symptoms, such as constant tears, burning eyes, and redness. 

<h2>What is Lacrimation?</h2>

Lacrimation is a condition in which the eyes produce an excessive amount of tears. This can be caused by a number of factors, including allergies, irritants, and emotional triggers. In some cases, the tears may be the result of a more serious underlying health condition, such as an infection or an autoimmune disorder. 

<h2>What Causes Lacrimation?</h2>

There are a few potential causes of lacrimation, including allergies, irritants, and emotional triggers. Allergies can cause the eyes to become dry and irritated, resulting in an excessive production of tears. Common allergens include pollen, dust, pet dander, and certain medications. Irritants, such as smoke and air pollution, can also cause the eyes to become irritated and watery. Finally, emotional triggers can cause the eyes to tear up, such as when a person is feeling sad or overwhelmed. 

<h2>How is Lacrimation Treated?</h2>

Fortunately, lacrimation can be treated with a variety of treatments. The first step is to identify the underlying cause of the condition and make lifestyle changes to reduce the symptoms. For example, if allergies are the cause, then avoiding the allergen or taking an over-the-counter antihistamine may help. If irritants are the cause, then avoiding the irritant or wearing protective eyewear may help. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid or anti-inflammatory medication to reduce eye irritation. 

<h2>Can Lacrimation be Prevented?</h2>

Yes, there are several ways to prevent lacrimation. The most important step is to identify the underlying cause and make lifestyle changes to reduce the symptoms. For example, if allergies are the cause, then avoiding the allergen or taking an over-the-counter antihistamine may help. If irritants are the cause, then avoiding the irritant or wearing protective eyewear may help. Finally, emotional triggers can be managed with relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation.
