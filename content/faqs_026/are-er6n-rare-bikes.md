<p>Kawasaki's ER6N or Ninja 650R is an incredibly popular motorcycle. It combines an affordable price tag, a reliable engine, great handling, and an attractive design that appeals to a wide range of riders. But is it a rare bike?</p>

<p>The answer to that question depends on your definition of rare. According to Kawasaki, the ER6N has been produced in large numbers since its introduction in 2006. In fact, it is one of the best-selling Kawasaki models of all time, with over 700,000 units sold worldwide. It is also a popular choice for custom builds, so finding one for sale is generally not a difficult task. Therefore, it cannot be considered a rare bike in the traditional sense.</p>

<p>However, there are certain variants of the ER6N that are considered rare. For example, the limited-edition 30th Anniversary model, released in 2016, was produced in very small numbers and can now command a premium price. There are also some rare color options, such as the KRT (Kawasaki Racing Team) edition, which was available in a unique black and green livery. </p>

<p>In addition to these limited-edition models, there are some rarer versions of the ER6N that can be found on the used market. These include the F model, which was available in Europe and Australia in 2008, and the SE model, which was only produced in the UK. Both of these models had unique styling, and they are now highly sought-after by collectors.</p>

<p>The ER6N is also popular among custom builders, and there are some unique builds out there that could be considered rare. These can range from mild modifications, such as a different exhaust or handlebars, to full-on custom builds with one-off parts. Many of these custom builds are available for sale, but they tend to be quite expensive due to their rarity.</p>

<p>So, to answer the question of whether the ER6N is a rare bike, the answer is both yes and no. It is a very popular motorcycle, but certain variants and custom builds can be considered rare. If youâ€™re looking for a rare bike, then it is worth doing some research to find out if any of these models are available.</p>
