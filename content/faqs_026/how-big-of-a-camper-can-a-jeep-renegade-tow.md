<p>The Jeep Renegade is a popular small SUV, boasting a stylish design, off-road capabilities, and a surprising amount of tow capacity. If you’re looking for a great vehicle to tow a camper or trailer, the Jeep Renegade is an excellent option. But just how big of a camper can a Jeep Renegade tow?</p>

<p>The Jeep Renegade has a maximum tow capacity of 2,000 lbs. This is enough to tow most small campers, although there are some larger campers that may exceed that capacity. It’s important to check the weight of your camper or trailer before towing it with the Jeep Renegade to make sure it’s within the tow capacity.</p>

<p>When towing with the Jeep Renegade, it’s important to keep the load balanced. The Renegade has a maximum tongue weight limit of 200 lbs, which is the maximum amount of weight that can be applied to the hitch. It’s important to keep the tongue weight as close as possible to this limit, as an unbalanced load can cause the Renegade to become unstable and dangerous to tow.</p>

<p>In addition to the tow capacity, the Jeep Renegade also has a maximum payload capacity of 1,000 lbs. This is the total weight of passengers and cargo that can be safely loaded into the vehicle. It’s important to check the payload capacity of the Jeep Renegade before loading it up with passengers and cargo, as an overloaded vehicle can cause poor handling and increased wear and tear on the vehicle.</p>

This includes a hitch, wiring harness, and ball mount. The Jeep Renegade is also equipped with trailer sway control, which helps to keep the trailer stable when towing.</p>

<p>Once the towing equipment is properly installed, it’s time to hook up the camper or trailer. Make sure the trailer is properly connected to the hitch, with the tongue weight within the prescribed limits. Then, connect the trailer’s electrical wiring harness to the wiring harness of the Jeep Renegade. This will provide power to the trailer’s lights and brakes.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s important to check the trailer’s tire pressure and make sure the brakes are properly adjusted before towing. Once everything is ready to go, the Jeep Renegade is ready to tow.</p>

<h2>What Are The Benefits of Towing With The Jeep Renegade?</h2>

<h2>What Are The Drawbacks of Towing With The Jeep Renegade?</h2>
