<p>Pregnancy can be a difficult and tiring time, but it's also a very exciting one. As your due date draws closer, the thought of travelling while pregnant – whether it's a holiday, a business trip, or a visit to family and friends – can be tempting. But is it safe to travel while pregnant? Can you travel when you're 37 weeks pregnant? Let's take a look.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of Travelling When You're 37 Weeks Pregnant?</h2>

<p>Travelling late in pregnancy has some risks. When you’re 37 weeks pregnant, the baby is nearly full-term and can arrive any day. If you travel too close to your due date, there’s the risk that you won’t be able to get back home in time for the birth. If you have a medical condition or a high-risk pregnancy, it’s important to check with your doctor about any risks associated with travelling late in pregnancy.</p>

<p>Travelling late in pregnancy can also cause physical discomfort. As your baby grows, it can press on your bladder, making it difficult to get comfortable, especially while sitting in a plane or car for long periods of time. In addition, the changes in air pressure can cause swelling, and your body may not be able to process fluids as quickly as it did before, making it more likely that you’ll become dehydrated.</p>

<h2>How Can You Reduce the Risks of Travelling When You're 37 Weeks Pregnant?</h2>

<p>If you do choose to travel while 37 weeks pregnant, there are a few things you can do to reduce the risks. First, plan your trip in advance. Make sure you have a reliable way to get to the hospital if you go into labor – either by car or by plane. Make sure you have all the necessary medical documents and records with you, in case you have to be admitted to a hospital. </p>

<p>It’s also important to stay hydrated and rest as much as possible while travelling. Wear comfortable clothing and take breaks often. If you’re flying, try to get an aisle seat so you can get up and walk around at least once an hour. Also, be aware of the altitude – if you’re flying, try to avoid flying above 8,000 feet.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do if You Go Into Labor While Travelling?</h2>

<p>If you do go into labor while travelling, the most important thing is to stay calm. Try to find a medical professional as soon as possible, either at the airport or the local hospital. Let them know that you’re in labor, and they should be able to provide you with the necessary medical attention. If you’re travelling by car, try to get to a hospital as soon as possible, and call your doctor or midwife to let them know what’s happening.</p>
