Helicoils are fasteners that are used to secure threaded fasteners and other components in a variety of applications. Helicoils, sometimes referred to as "threaded inserts," are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and military industries, but they can also be used in other industries, including marine and industrial. Helicoils come in a variety of sizes and shapes and are used to provide a stronger, more secure grip than traditional threaded fasteners.

<h2>How Do Helicoils Work?</h2>

Helicoils are essentially a coiled wire that is inserted into a hole to create a female thread. The wire is constructed from a high-tensile alloy steel and is pre-formed into a tight coil. The wire is then inserted into the hole, and a tool is used to compress the coil and form it into the shape of the female thread. Once the coil is compressed, the threads are mechanically locked in place and the Helicoil is ready for use.

<h2>How Are Helicoils Installed?</h2>

Helicoils are typically installed with a tool called a "tap wrench." The tap wrench is designed to fit into the hole and compress the coil into the desired shape. The tap wrench is then turned to insert the Helicoil into the hole and the coil is then securely locked in place. Once the Helicoil is installed, the tap wrench is removed and the Helicoil is ready to accept the threaded fastener.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Using Helicoils?</h2>

Helicoils offer a number of advantages over traditional threaded fasteners. Since the coil is mechanically locked in place, the thread is much stronger and more secure than traditional fasteners. Helicoils are also more resistant to corrosion and vibration, making them ideal for use in harsh environments. Furthermore, Helicoils can be used to repair damaged threads, making them an ideal solution for applications where thread repair is needed.

<h2>What Types of Helicoils Are Available?</h2>

Helicoils come in a variety of sizes and types. The most common types are standard, coarse, fine, and extra-fine. The thread size is determined by the diameter of the wire in the coil and the thread pitch is determined by the number of turns in the coil. Helicoils can also be made to any thread pitch and diameter, allowing for a more customized solution.

<h2>Are Helicoils Reusable?</h2>

Helicoils are designed to be reusable. The coils can be removed and re-installed multiple times without any loss of strength or performance. However, it is important to inspect the Helicoil before use to ensure that the threads are not damaged or worn.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is a Helicoil?</h3>
A Helicoil is a fastener that is used to secure threaded fasteners and other components in a variety of applications. Helicoils are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and military industries, but they can also be used in other industries, including marine and industrial.

<h3>Are Helicoils Reusable?</h3>
Helicoils are designed to be reusable. The coils can be removed and re-installed multiple times without any loss of strength or performance. However, it is important to inspect the Helicoil before use to ensure that the threads are not damaged or worn.

<h3>Can Helicoils Be Used To Repair Damaged Threads?</h3>
Yes, Helicoils can be used to repair damaged threads. The Helicoil is inserted into the hole and the coil is then compressed to form the female thread. The threads are then mechanically locked in place, making them more secure and resistant to corrosion and vibration.

<h3>What Is The Difference Between Standard And Fine Helicoils?</h3>
The main difference between standard and fine Helicoils is the thread size. Standard Helicoils have a larger diameter wire and a lower thread pitch, while fine Helicoils have a smaller diameter wire and a higher thread pitch. The thread size and pitch of the Helicoil should be selected based on the application.

<h3>What Is The Maximum Pressure A Helicoil Can Withstand?</h3>
The maximum pressure that a Helicoil can withstand depends on the size and type of the coil. Generally speaking, Helicoils can withstand pressures up to 16,000 pounds per square inch (psi).

<h3>Can Helicoils Be Installed Without Special Tools?</h3>
No, Helicoils require a special tool called a tap wrench in order to be properly installed. The tap wrench is designed to fit into the hole and compress the coil into the desired shape. The tap wrench is then turned to insert the Helicoil into the hole and the coil is then securely locked in place.

<h3>Are Helicoils Affected By Corrosion?</h3>
No, Helicoils are designed to be resistant to corrosion. The wire is constructed from a high-tensile alloy steel and is pre-formed into a tight coil. The threads are then mechanically locked in place, making them more resistant to corrosion and vibration.
