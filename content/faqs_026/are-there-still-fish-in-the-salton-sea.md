Are there Still Fish in the Salton Sea?

The Salton Sea is a large lake in southeastern California, between the Coachella Valley and the Imperial Valley. It is the largest lake in California, and is home to a number of species of fish, birds, and other wildlife. The lake was created in 1905 when flooding caused the Colorado River to breach a natural levee. Over the years, the lake has become increasingly salty and its water quality has deteriorated. The question remains - are there still fish in the Salton Sea?
