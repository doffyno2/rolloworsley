Conan Exiles is an open-world survival game set in the brutal lands of Conan the Barbarian. In the game, players must survive the harsh environment, build a base, explore the Exiled Lands, and battle monsters and other players. As players progress in the game, they will gain access to new abilities, weapons, and tools, including the ability to fast travel. But how do you fast travel in Conan Exiles?

<h2>Fast Travel Basics</h2>

Before you can fast travel, you must first unlock the ability. To unlock fast travel, you must build a bedroll and place it at the desired location. Once the bedroll is placed, you will be able to fast travel to that location from any bedroll in the game.

<h2>How to Place a Bedroll</h2>

The first step to fast traveling in Conan Exiles is to build a bedroll. To build a bedroll, you will need a Sawmill and at least 30 wood. Once you have the materials, open your inventory and select the bedroll. Place the bedroll at the desired location, and it will be ready to use for fast travel.

<h2>How to Fast Travel</h2>

Once you have placed a bedroll, you can fast travel to it from any other bedroll in the game. To fast travel, open your map and select the bedroll you want to travel to. You will then be asked to confirm the fast travel, and once confirmed, you will be teleported to the bedroll's location.

<h2>Benefits of Fast Travel</h2>

Fast travel can be a useful tool for quickly moving around the Exiled Lands. It can also be used to escape dangerous situations, as well as to get to places that would normally be too far away to reach. Additionally, fast travel can be used to quickly move between your base and other locations.

<h2>Limitations of Fast Travel</h2>

Fast travel is not without its limitations. For example, when fast traveling, you will be unable to take any items with you, as they will be left behind at the bedroll you are teleporting from. Additionally, fast travel is limited to only bedrolls that you have placed, so you will not be able to fast travel to any bedrolls that other players have placed.
