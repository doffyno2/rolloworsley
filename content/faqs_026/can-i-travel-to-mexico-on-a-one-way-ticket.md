<h2>Do I Need a Round Trip Ticket to Enter Mexico?</h2>

In general, yes, travelers to Mexico are required to present a round trip ticket when entering the country. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule.

However, it is important to remember that day trips are strictly regulated, and travelers must adhere to certain guidelines in order to be allowed to enter the country. For example, travelers must return to their home country before the end of the day, and they must not stay in Mexico for more than 24 hours.
