Can My Dog Use A Flea Collar With NexGard?



Fleas are one of the most common problems pet owners face and can be a real nuisance for both you and your pet. NexGard is a popular flea and tick treatment for dogs and cats, but many pet owners wonder if it's safe to use a flea collar with NexGard. The short answer is yes, but there are a few important things to consider before using both treatments together.

<h2>What Is NexGard?</h2>

NexGard is an oral flea and tick treatment for dogs and cats. It's a soft chewable tablet that contains an insecticide called afoxolaner. This insecticide works by killing fleas and ticks on contact, as well as preventing new fleas and ticks from infesting your pet. It's available in a range of doses and can be given either as a single dose or as a monthly treatment.

<h2>Can My Dog Use A Flea Collar With NexGard?</h2>

Yes, your dog can use a flea collar along with NexGard. Flea collars are an effective way to help prevent infestations, but they're not as effective as NexGard at killing fleas and ticks on contact. So, if you're using a flea collar, it's important to also use NexGard to ensure that any existing fleas and ticks are killed quickly.

<h2>How Should I Use A Flea Collar With NexGard?</h2>

The best way to use a flea collar with NexGard is to first apply the flea collar according to the manufacturer's directions. Once the collar is in place, follow the instructions for giving your pet NexGard. It's important to make sure that your pet takes the full dose of NexGard, as this will ensure that any existing fleas and ticks are quickly killed.

<h2>Are There Any Precautions I Should Take When Using A Flea Collar With NexGard?</h2>

Yes, there are some precautions you should take when using a flea collar with NexGard. First, it's important to make sure that your pet doesn't have any existing flea or tick infestations before using the flea collar. If your pet does have an infestation, it's best to treat it first with NexGard before applying the collar. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the flea collar is properly fitted and that your pet can't chew or scratch it off. Finally, it's important to follow the manufacturer's instructions for both the flea collar and NexGard to ensure that your pet is receiving the appropriate dosage.

<h2>Can I Use A Flea Collar With Other Flea Treatments?</h2>

Yes, you can use a flea collar with other flea treatments, including topical spot-on treatments and oral medications. However, it's important to make sure that you're not using two products that contain the same active ingredients. Additionally, it's important to make sure that the flea collar is properly fitted and that your pet can't chew or scratch it off.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Flea collars can be used in conjunction with NexGard to help prevent infestations and keep your pet safe from fleas and ticks. However, it's important to make sure that the collar is properly fitted and that your pet can't chew or scratch it off. Additionally, it's important to make sure that you're not using two products that contain the same active ingredients, and that you're following the manufacturer's instructions for both the flea collar and NexGard.
