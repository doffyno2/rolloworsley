<p>Gymnasts have long used leotards as their go-to outfit for practice and performances. But one of the major issues with leotards is that they can be difficult to keep in place. With the constant movement and leaps that gymnasts make, it can be hard to keep leotards from shifting and bunching up. Fortunately, there are a few tips and tricks that gymnasts can use to keep their leotards in place while they perform.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Size Leotard</h2>

<p>One of the most important ways to ensure that your leotard stays in place is to choose the right size. If the leotard is too big, it may be difficult to keep in place. On the other hand, if it's too small, it may be uncomfortable and restrict movement. To get the right fit, many gymnasts turn to custom leotards or have them altered to their size. This can help make sure that the leotard fits perfectly and won't move around too much.</p>

<h2>Wear the Right Undergarments</h2>

<p>Another way to keep a leotard in place is to wear the right undergarments. The right bra, bike shorts, and bodysuit can make all the difference when it comes to keeping a leotard secure. Bike shorts can help to keep the leotard from riding up, while a bodysuit can help to keep the leotard from shifting. The right bra can also help to keep the leotard in place and provide support.</p>

<h2>Use Body Glide or Double-Sided Tape</h2>

<p>For extra security, many gymnasts also turn to body glide or double-sided tape. Body glide is a product that is applied to the skin before putting on the leotard. This can help to create a barrier between the skin and the leotard, reducing friction and keeping the leotard from shifting. Double-sided tape is another option. This can be applied to the leotard and the body, creating an extra layer of security and preventing the leotard from shifting.</p>

<h2>Adjust the Leotard As Needed</h2>

<p>Finally, gymnasts can also adjust their leotard as needed. During a routine, it's important to take the time to make sure that the leotard is still in the right place. This can help to reduce bunching and keep the leotard from shifting during a routine. Making minor adjustments can help to keep the leotard secure.</p>
