Does Anyone Like Drinking Hot Dog Water?


There may be some people out there who are brave enough to try drinking hot dog water, but for the most part, it's not something that is widely accepted. Hot dog water is a type of water that has been boiled and then mixed with hot dog bits, creating a salty, greasy liquid that many find unappealing.
