<p>Stove top drip pans can easily become stained, scratched, and discolored over time. Fortunately, you can save yourself time and money by learning how to paint your own stove top drip pans instead of replacing them. It's a simple job that can be done in less than an hour and can really brighten up your kitchen. </p>

<h2>What You Need to Paint Stove Top Drip Pans</h2>
<p>Before you start painting, you'll need to gather the following supplies: </p>
<ul>
    <li>High-temperature spray paint in your desired color </li>
    <li>Tack cloth </li>
    <li>Sandpaper </li>
    <li>Painter's tape </li>
    <li>Protective goggles </li>
    <li>Dust mask </li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing the Stove Top Drip Pans</h2>
<p>The first step in painting your stove top drip pans is to make sure they're clean and free of any grease or grime. Wash them in hot soapy water, then wipe them down with a tack cloth to remove any residue. Once you've done that, use sandpaper to lightly sand the surface of the drip pans. This will help the paint adhere to the surface and prevent chipping. </p>

<h2>Applying the Paint</h2>
<p>Once the drip pans are completely dry and free of dust, you're ready to begin painting. Put on your protective goggles and dust mask, then tape off any areas you don't want to paint. Make sure the area is well-ventilated before you begin spraying. Hold the can 8-10 inches away from the drip pans and spray in even, sweeping motions. Make sure to cover the entire surface. Let the paint dry for 15-20 minutes, then apply a second coat. </p>

<h2>Finishing the Job</h2>
<p>When the second coat has dried, you can remove the painter's tape and admire your new stove top drip pans. Make sure to only use them on a stove top with low to medium heat settings, as paint can become damaged when exposed to high temperatures. </p>
