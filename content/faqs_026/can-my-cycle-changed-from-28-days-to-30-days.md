<p>The menstrual cycle is a natural process that every woman goes through and is an important part of our reproductive health. The menstrual cycle usually lasts between 28 and 30 days and is divided into four phases: the menstrual phase, the follicular phase, the ovulatory phase, and the luteal phase. It is possible for the menstrual cycle to vary from month to month, but it is important to keep track of it for any changes that may occur. So, can your cycle change from 28 days to 30 days?</p>

<h2>Understanding the Menstrual Cycle and Its Variations</h2>

<p>The menstrual cycle is the monthly process through which a woman’s body prepares for pregnancy. It is divided into four phases: the menstrual phase, the follicular phase, the ovulatory phase, and the luteal phase. The average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days, but some women have shorter or longer cycles. A cycle that lasts between 21 and 35 days is considered normal.</p>

<p>The menstrual phase is the first phase of the menstrual cycle and usually lasts between three and five days. During this phase, the lining of the uterus sheds, resulting in bleeding and cramps. The bleeding usually occurs between 12 and 16 days before the start of the next menstrual cycle.</p>

<p>The follicular phase is the second phase of the menstrual cycle and usually lasts between seven and 10 days. During this phase, the ovaries produce follicles, which are small fluid-filled sacs that contain an egg. These follicles mature in preparation for ovulation.</p>

<p>The ovulatory phase is the third phase of the menstrual cycle and usually lasts between two and four days. During this phase, the follicles mature and one of them releases an egg. This is the time of the cycle when a woman is most likely to become pregnant.</p>

<p>The luteal phase is the fourth and final phase of the menstrual cycle and usually lasts between 12 and 16 days. During this phase, the body prepares for either pregnancy or the start of the next menstrual cycle.</p>
