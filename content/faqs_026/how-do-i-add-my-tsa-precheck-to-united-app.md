The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) PreCheck program is designed to help expedite the security screening process for travelers who have been pre-approved to receive expedited screening. The program is available for those who are enrolled in the TSA’s trusted traveler program and for members of certain airlines’ frequent flyer programs. For those who are enrolled in the PreCheck program, they can add their TSA PreCheck number to their United App, so that they can receive expedited security screening benefits when they travel with United Airlines.
