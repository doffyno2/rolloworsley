<p>Green spotted puffers (GSPs) are one of the most popular aquarium fish species, but they can be tricky to keep. Not only are they sensitive to water quality, they also have a reputation for being aggressive, so they need to be kept with other fish that can stand up to them. But, can GSPs live with other fish? The answer is, yes, they can – but you need to choose the right tankmates for them.</p>

<p>Green spotted puffers have a unique personality and can be quite territorial. They are not particularly social and prefer to swim alone, but they can be kept in tanks with other fish, as long as they are compatible. The most important factor when choosing tankmates for GSPs is to make sure they are not aggressive towards each other. GSPs are generally fine with peaceful fish such as tetras, guppies, mollies, and platies, but they may pick on smaller fish, so it’s best to avoid those.</p>

<h2>What To Look For When Choosing Tankmates For GSPs?</h2>

<p>When selecting tankmates for GSPs, look for fish that are of similar size and temperament. GSPs can be quite territorial and will defend their territory, so it’s important to choose fish that are not likely to provoke them. Fish that are too small or too shy may become easy targets for GSPs and could be injured or even killed. In addition, GSPs like to dig and should not be kept with smaller fish that are likely to be buried in the substrate.</p>

<p>GSPs can also be kept with larger, more active fish such as cichlids, barbs, and danios, as long as they are not aggressive. Some GSPs may still pick on larger fish, so it’s best to keep an eye on them and separate them if necessary. When in doubt, choose fish that are of similar size and temperament to the GSP.</p>

<h2>Can GSPs Live With Other Fish?</h2>

<p>The answer is yes, GSPs can live with other fish. However, it’s important to choose tankmates that are compatible and not likely to be attacked by the GSP. It’s also important to keep an eye on the tank and separate any fish that appear to be in conflict. With the right tankmates, GSPs can be a great addition to any aquarium.</p>
