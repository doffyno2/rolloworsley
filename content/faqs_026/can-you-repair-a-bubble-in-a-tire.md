<p>A tire bubble, also known as a tire sidewall bulge, is a visible protrusion or swelling on the sidewall of a tire. The bubble may appear as a single, localized bulge or as a series of bulges along the sidewall. A tire bubble can occur for a variety of reasons, including improper inflation, excessive heat exposure, or an object puncturing the tire. It is important to recognize the signs of a tire bubble and take steps to repair or replace the tire as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Tire Bubble?</h2>

<p>A tire bubble can be caused by a few different factors. Most commonly, a tire bubble is caused by an object puncturing the sidewall of the tire. This can be something as small as a nail or something more substantial such as a broken piece of glass. The puncture causes air to leak out of the tire and the pressure inside the tire drops, which can cause the sidewall to bulge or bubble.</p>

<p>In some cases, a tire bubble can be caused by improper inflation. If a tire is overinflated or underinflated, it can cause the sidewall to bulge or bubble. Overinflated tires can also be more susceptible to damage from sharp objects, which can cause a tire bubble.</p>

<p>Finally, excessive heat exposure can also cause a tire bubble. All tires are designed to withstand a certain level of heat, but if the tire is exposed to too much heat, it can cause the rubber to expand and the sidewall to bulge or bubble.</p>

<h2>How Can You Tell If Your Tire Has a Bubble?</h2>

<p>There are a few different signs that indicate your tire may have a bubble. The most obvious sign is a visible bulge or swelling on the sidewall of the tire. If you notice any kind of bubble or bulge on the sidewall, it is important to check the tire immediately.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may also be able to feel a tire bubble. If you run your hand along the sidewall, you may be able to feel an area that is softer than the rest of the tire. This could indicate that the tire has a bubble.</p>

<p>Finally, if you have recently had a flat tire, it is important to inspect the tire for any signs of a bubble. If the puncture was not repaired in time, the tire may have developed a bubble.</p>

<h2>Can You Repair a Tire Bubble?</h2>

<p>In some cases, it is possible to repair a tire bubble. If the bubble is small and localized, it is possible to inject a sealant into the tire which will seal the puncture and stop the air from leaking out. This can help to reduce the size of the bubble and restore the tire's pressure.</p>

<p>However, if the bubble is large or if the puncture is too severe, it is not possible to repair the tire. In these cases, the tire will need to be replaced.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do If Your Tire Has a Bubble?</h2>

<p>If you notice a bubble on the sidewall of your tire, it is important to take action immediately. The first step is to inspect the tire for any signs of a puncture. If you find a puncture, you should repair or replace the tire as soon as possible.</p>

<p>If you do not find a puncture, it is important to have the tire inspected by a professional. A mechanic or tire specialist will be able to inspect the tire and determine if it can be repaired or if it needs to be replaced.</p>
