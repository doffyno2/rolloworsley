<p>It is understandable that pet owners want to provide the best care possible for their four-legged friends. Many times, this includes providing medications that can help alleviate discomfort from conditions such as allergies or anxiety. Benadryl and melatonin are two of the most popular medications for dogs, and many pet owners wonder if it is safe to give their pets both of these medications at the same time.</p>

<p>In general, it is not recommended to give any pet two medications that have similar effects.
