Gorilla Glue is a strong adhesive that is commonly used for a variety of DIY projects, from furniture assembly to repairing broken items around the house. Unfortunately, it’s not uncommon for people to end up with Gorilla Glue on their skin, and it can be an annoying and difficult task to get rid of. Here we’ll look at the various ways you can remove Gorilla Glue from your skin, so you can get back to your project without any further hassle. 

<h2>What Causes Gorilla Glue To Stick?</h2>

Gorilla Glue is an incredibly effective adhesive because it contains a polymer that is activated when it comes in contact with moisture. This polymer bonds to the surfaces to which it is applied and creates an incredibly strong bond that is difficult to break. Unfortunately, this means it can also be difficult to remove from skin. 

<h2>How To Remove Gorilla Glue From Your Skin</h2>

Fortunately, there are a few methods you can use to remove Gorilla Glue from your fingers. Here are a few of the most effective techniques: 

<h3>Method 1: Acetone</h3>

Acetone is a powerful solvent and is effective at dissolving Gorilla Glue. To use acetone, you’ll need to soak a cotton ball in acetone and then apply it to the affected area for a few minutes. Once the Gorilla Glue has been softened, you can gently rub it off with a cloth or paper towel. 

<h3>Method 2: Isopropyl Alcohol</h3>

Isopropyl alcohol is another solvent that can be used to dissolve Gorilla Glue. To use it, you’ll need to soak a cotton swab in the alcohol and then apply it to the affected area. Allow the alcohol to sit for a few minutes before gently rubbing the glue off with a cloth or paper towel. 

<h3>Method 3: Soap and Water</h3>

If you don’t have access to acetone or isopropyl alcohol, then a simple mixture of soap and water can be used to remove Gorilla Glue. To use this method, you’ll need to create a lather with soap and water, and then apply it to the affected area. Rub the lather gently, and the Gorilla Glue should begin to loosen. Once the glue has been softened, you can then use a cloth or paper towel to wipe it off. 

<h3>Method 4: Cooking Oil</h3>

Cooking oil can also be used to remove Gorilla Glue from skin. To use this method, you’ll need to apply a generous amount of cooking oil to the affected area and then leave it for a few minutes. Once the oil has had a chance to penetrate the glue, you can then use a cloth or paper towel to wipe it off. 

<h2>Tips For Avoiding Gorilla Glue On Your Skin</h2>

Although there are a number of methods you can use to remove Gorilla Glue from skin, it’s best to try to avoid getting it on your skin in the first place. Here are a few tips for avoiding Gorilla Glue on your skin: 

<h3>Wear Gloves</h3>

One of the best ways to avoid getting Gorilla Glue on your skin is to wear gloves while you’re working with it. This will help to keep your skin protected, and will also make it easier to clean up any accidental spills. 

<h3>Clean Up Spills Immediately</h3>

Gorilla Glue is extremely sticky, so it’s important to clean up any spills as soon as they occur. If you wait too long, the glue will have hardened and it will be much more difficult to remove. 

<h3>Use A Protective Barrier</h3>

If you don’t want to wear gloves, then you can also use a protective barrier, such as petroleum jelly, to protect your skin from the Gorilla Glue. Just apply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the areas of your skin that are likely to come into contact with the glue, and it should help to keep the glue from sticking to your skin.
