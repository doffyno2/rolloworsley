Centipedes and millipedes are two of the most common arthropods found in the home. While they may look similar, they are actually very different creatures, and it’s important to know the difference between them. It’s also important to know if either of these creatures can pose a threat to your pet, especially if you have a dog. 

<h2>What Are Centipedes and Millipedes?</h2>

Centipedes and millipedes are both members of the Myriapoda class, which includes all arthropods with many legs. Centipedes are distinguished by their flat, segmented bodies and two legs on each segment. They typically range from one to six inches in length and can be found in a variety of colors. Centipedes are predators and feed on insects, spiders, and even small mammals.

Millipedes, on the other hand, are characterized by their round bodies, three to four pairs of legs on each segment, and two antennae. They range from one-half to four inches in length and come in a variety of colors. Unlike centipedes, millipedes are primarily herbivores, meaning they feed on decaying plant matter and fungi. 

<h2>Are Centipedes and Millipedes Poisonous to Dogs?</h2>

The answer to this question is both yes and no, depending on the species. Centipedes are venomous, meaning they have a pair of venom glands connected to modified legs called forcipules. If a centipede bites a dog, the venom can cause pain, swelling, and even death, depending on the size of the centipede and the sensitivity of the dog. 

Millipedes, on the other hand, are not venomous, but they do produce a liquid that can cause skin irritation and even temporary blindness if it gets into the eyes. While this liquid is not toxic, it can cause irritation, so it’s best to keep your dog away from millipedes. 

<h2>How to Keep Centipedes and Millipedes Out of Your Home</h2>

The best way to keep centipedes and millipedes away from your home is to make sure it is properly sealed. Check for potential entry points, such as cracks and crevices in walls, windows, and doors, and use caulk or other sealants to close them off. Additionally, be sure to keep your home free of clutter, as centipedes and millipedes are attracted to places that offer them shelter.

<h2>What to Do if Your Dog Comes into Contact with a Centipede or Millipede</h2>

If your dog comes into contact with a centipede, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. Depending on the species, the venom from a centipede bite can be very dangerous, so it is best to take your dog to the vet as soon as possible.

If your dog comes into contact with a millipede, it is important to flush any areas that may have come into contact with its secretions. If there is any skin irritation, be sure to use a mild soap and cool water to clean the area. If the irritation persists, contact your veterinarian.
