<p>A condominium association is an organization of condominium owners that manages, maintains, and enforces the rules and regulations of the condominium community. It is responsible for ensuring that all members of the association have access to the common areas, such as pools, recreational facilities, and other amenities. The association is also responsible for maintaining the grounds, common areas, and interior of the condominiums. As such, the association must cover the regular maintenance costs associated with these responsibilities.</p>

<h2>What Are the Maintenance Costs?</h2>

<p>The maintenance costs associated with a condominium association include the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lawn care, landscaping, and gardening</li>
  <li>Common area cleaning and maintenance</li>
  <li>Snow removal</li>
  <li>Pool maintenance and repair</li>
  <li>Building repairs and maintenance</li>
  <li>Pest control</li>
  <li>Utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and sewerage</li>
  <li>Security systems</li>
</ul>

<p>Other costs may include building insurance, legal fees, and exterior painting.</p>

<h2>How Does the Association Cover These Costs?</h2>

<p>The condominium association typically covers these costs through the collection of monthly or quarterly assessments from each unit owner. Assessments are typically collected in the form of a “per unit” fee. This fee is used to pay for the regular maintenance costs associated with the association. It is important to note that assessments are not taxes, as they are not levied by the government. Instead, they are fees collected by the condominium association to cover its expenses.</p>

<p>In addition to assessments, condominium associations may also generate income from other sources, such as rental income from tenants or tenants’ fees for common areas or special amenities. This income can be used to cover the regular maintenance costs associated with the association.</p>

<h2>What Happens If the Association Does Not Have Enough Money to Cover the Costs?</h2>

<p>If the condominium association does not have enough money to cover its regular maintenance costs, it may be forced to take out a loan or increase the assessment fees. It is important to note that the association can only increase assessment fees if the governing documents, such as the bylaws or restrictive covenants, allow it. Any changes to assessment fees must be approved by a majority of the unit owners.</p>

<p>It is also important to note that if the association does not have enough money to cover its regular maintenance costs, it may be forced to reduce or eliminate certain services or amenities. This could include reducing the number of employees, eliminating certain amenities, or cutting back on other services.</p>

<h2>How Can Unit Owners Help?</h2>

<p>Unit owners can help their condominium association cover regular maintenance costs by volunteering their time or donating money. Unit owners can also help by participating in projects or activities that will generate income for the association such as renting out units or providing services to tenants.</p>
