Once the knife is wrapped in bubble wrap, it should be placed in a sturdy box or container. This will help to ensure that the knife is secure during transit and that it won't become accessible to the public.

<h3>Secure the Knife in Place</h3>

Once the knife is placed in a box or container, it should be securely fastened in place. This can be done by using tape, bubble wrap, or any other material that will keep the knife in place during transit.

<h3>Label the Package as Containing a Knife</h3>

It's important to clearly label the package as containing a knife. This will help to ensure that the package is properly handled by USPS personnel and that it doesn't become accessible to the public during transit. Additionally, it's important to clearly label the package as containing a knife in order to avoid any potential legal issues.
