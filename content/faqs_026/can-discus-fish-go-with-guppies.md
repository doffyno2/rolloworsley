<p>Discus fish and guppies are both beautiful and popular fish species. Both are popular with fish keepers due to their bright colors and peaceful nature. However, it is important to consider whether these two species can be safely kept together in the same aquarium. To answer this question, it is important to consider the individual needs of each species and understand how they can interact with each other.</p>

<h2>The Natural Habitats of Discus Fish and Guppies</h2>

<p>Discus fish, also known as Symphysodon aequifasciatus, are native to the Amazon River basin in South America. They live in slow-moving, acidic blackwater habitats. Guppies, also known as Poecilia reticulata, are native to coastal rivers of South America. They prefer slower-moving, alkaline waters with plenty of plants and cover. As such, the two species have different natural habitats and water requirements and should not be kept together in the same aquarium.</p>

<h2>Differences in Water Requirements for Discus Fish and Guppies</h2>

<p>Discus fish require soft, acidic water with a temperature of 77 to 84 degrees Fahrenheit. They also require very clean water with a low nitrate level. Guppies, on the other hand, prefer slightly harder water with a slightly higher temperature of 78 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit. They are also able to tolerate higher nitrate levels than Discus fish. As such, keeping the two species together in the same aquarium can be difficult, as the water conditions required by each species are different.</p>

<h2>Differences in Diet for Discus Fish and Guppies</h2>

<p>Discus fish are carnivorous and require a diet of high-quality frozen and live foods. They should be fed a variety of different foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and daphnia. Guppies, on the other hand, are omnivorous and require a diet of flake and freeze-dried foods. They should be fed a variety of different foods such as bloodworms, brine shrimp, and vegetable-based flakes.</p>

<h2>Differences in Behavior for Discus Fish and Guppies</h2>

<p>Discus fish are relatively peaceful, but they can be territorial and aggressive towards other fish. They should be kept in a single-species tank or with other peaceful fish of the same size. Guppies, on the other hand, are peaceful and can be kept in a community tank with other peaceful fish of the same size. As such, keeping the two species together in the same aquarium can be difficult, as their behaviors may conflict.</p>

<h2>Conclusion: Can Discus Fish Go With Guppies?</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it is not recommended to keep Discus fish and guppies together in the same aquarium. The two species have different water requirements and diet, and their behaviors may conflict. Therefore, it is best to keep them in separate tanks. However, if you are determined to keep them together, it is important to ensure that the water parameters are suitable for both species and that they are given the right diet.</p>
