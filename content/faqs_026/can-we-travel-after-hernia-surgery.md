<p>Hernia surgery can be a life-saving procedure, but it can also present a host of challenges and difficulties. One of the most common questions asked by those who have undergone hernia surgery is whether or not they can travel afterwards. The answer to this question depends on several factors, including the type of hernia surgery performed, the recovery time required, and the type of travel involved. In this article, we will discuss these factors and provide some tips on how to stay safe while travelling after hernia surgery.</p>

<p>The type of hernia surgery performed will have an impact on the amount of time that must be allowed for recovery before travel can be considered. For example, open hernia repair surgery typically requires a longer recovery time than laparoscopic surgery due to the larger incision and greater tissue damage.
