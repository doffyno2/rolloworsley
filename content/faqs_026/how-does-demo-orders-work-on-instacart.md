How Does Demo Orders Work On Instacart?


Instacart is an online delivery service that offers a convenient way to shop for groceries. It is available in select cities across the United States and Canada. With Instacart, customers can order groceries online and have them delivered to their doorstep within an hour. Instacart also offers demo orders, which allow customers to sample products before committing to buying them.


Instacart demo orders are available for select items in the store. When a customer adds an item to their cart, they will be offered an option to add a demo order of the item. A demo order allows customers to receive a sample of the product before committing to buying it. Demo orders typically come in smaller sizes than the regular item, and customers are only charged for the demo order, not for the full-size version of the item.
