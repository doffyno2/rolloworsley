<p>The world of Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is one of the most detailed and immersive video game universes ever created. It features an expansive, open-world that allows players to explore a wide range of locations and interact with a variety of characters. One of the most interesting aspects of this game is that it features an in-game passage of time, meaning that certain events will only occur at certain times of day. This means that players need to be aware of the passage of time in order to complete certain tasks, such as tracking down enemies or discovering secret items. But the question remains: does fast travel advance time in Shadow of Mordor?</p>

<h2>What is Fast Travel?</h2>

<p>Fast travel is a mechanic in Shadow of Mordor that allows you to quickly move around the map. It requires that you have discovered a location on your map first, and then you can simply click on it to teleport there instantly. This can save a lot of time, especially when you need to traverse long distances. It’s also useful if you’re trying to find a specific location and don’t want to get lost along the way.</p>

<h2>Can I Fast Travel Anywhere?</h2>
