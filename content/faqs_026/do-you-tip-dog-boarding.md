When your four-legged family member is going away for a while, it's important to make sure that they're taken care of and safe. Dog boarding is a great way to do this, and there are many different types of boarding options. But do you tip dog boarding, and if so, how much? It's a question that many pet owners struggle with, and we're here to give you the answers. 

<h2>What Is Dog Boarding?</h2>

Dog boarding is a service provided by professionals who specialize in caring for dogs while their owners are away from home. It is similar to dog daycare, but involves a longer stay, usually a few days or weeks. Boarding facilities typically provide food, water, exercise, potty breaks, and a safe, comfortable environment for your pup.

<h2>Do You Tip Dog Boarding?</h2>

In general, tipping is not expected when it comes to dog boarding. However, if you feel that the staff has gone above and beyond in taking care of your pup, it is appropriate to offer a tip as a sign of appreciation. 

<h2>How Much Should You Tip Dog Boarding?</h2>

If you choose to tip the staff at a dog boarding facility, the amount should be based on the level of service you received. A good rule of thumb is to offer 10-15% of the total bill, depending on how much extra care was provided. You can also offer a gift card or a special treat for the staff to show your appreciation. 

<h2>What Should You Consider Before Tipping Dog Boarding?</h2>

Before you decide to tip a dog boarding facility, it's important to consider the level of service you received. Did the staff go above and beyond to ensure your pup's safety and comfort? Did they provide extra care, such as administering medications or providing special treats? If so, then it's appropriate to offer a tip as a sign of appreciation. 

<h2>Are There Other Ways To Show Appreciation To A Dog Boarding Facility?</h2>

In addition to offering a tip, there are other ways to show your appreciation to a dog boarding facility. You can write a positive review on Yelp or Google, or you can refer a friend to the facility. You can also send a thank you note or a gift to the staff to let them know how much you appreciated their care.

Tipping is not expected when it comes to dog boarding, but it is a nice gesture to show appreciation for the care your pup received.
