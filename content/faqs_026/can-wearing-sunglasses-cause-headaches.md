<p>The short answer is yes, wearing sunglasses can cause headaches. It may not be immediately noticeable, but if you wear your sunglasses for too long, you may start to feel the effects. There are several reasons why wearing sunglasses can cause headaches and it is important to understand why it is happening so that you can take steps to prevent it from happening again.</p>

<h2>How Can Wearing Sunglasses Cause Headaches?</h2>

<p>There are several factors that might lead to headaches when wearing sunglasses. One of the main causes is the way that sunglasses lenses block out the light. The lenses of sunglasses are designed to reduce the amount of light that enters your eyes, but this can be too much for some people. The lenses may block out some of the light that your eyes need to adjust and this can cause headaches.</p>

<p>Another reason why wearing sunglasses can cause headaches is because of the lack of contrast. Sunglasses tend to reduce the contrast between the light and dark areas, which can cause your eyes to strain as they try to adjust. This strain can lead to headaches.</p>

<p>Finally, wearing sunglasses for too long can cause your eyes to become dry and irritated. This can lead to headaches as well. If you wear your sunglasses for extended periods of time, it is important to take breaks from wearing them to allow your eyes to rest.</p>

<h2>How To Prevent Sunglasses Causing Headaches</h2>

<p>There are several steps you can take to prevent sunglasses from causing headaches. The first is to make sure that the sunglasses you are wearing are the right size for your face. Sunglasses that are too small or too large can cause your eyes to strain, leading to headaches.</p>

<p>Another important step is to make sure that you are wearing sunglasses with the right lenses. Different lenses can block out different amounts of light and some lenses may be too strong for your eyes. Make sure to try on different lenses to find the right one for you.</p>

<p>Finally, if you wear your sunglasses for extended periods of time, make sure to take breaks. This will give your eyes a chance to rest and prevent your eyes from becoming dry and irritated.</p>
