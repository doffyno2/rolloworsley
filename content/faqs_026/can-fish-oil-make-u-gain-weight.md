Fish oil is an omega-3 fatty acid supplement made from the tissues of oily fish. It is rich in two types of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which are known to have many health benefits. Fish oil has been studied for its potential to help people gain weight, but the results have been mixed. In this article, we'll explore the evidence for and against fish oil for weight gain and discuss the potential risks and benefits.

<h2>What Is Fish Oil?</h2>

Fish oil is a natural supplement made from the tissues of oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring, and sardines. It is rich in two types of omega-3 fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). These fatty acids are essential for human health, but they can’t be made by the body and must be obtained from food or supplements.

Fish oil is available in liquid, capsule, and softgel forms. It is also used as an ingredient in some foods, such as salad dressings and mayonnaise. Fish oil is usually taken as a supplement to get the recommended daily intake of omega-3 fatty acids, which is 1,000–2,000mg per day.

<h2>Does Fish Oil Make You Gain Weight?</h2>

The effects of fish oil on weight gain are mixed. Some studies suggest that fish oil supplements may help people gain weight, while others suggest they do not.

A review of 24 studies found that fish oil supplements were associated with modest increases in body weight in adults. However, the increases were not considered clinically significant.

Another review of 12 studies found that fish oil supplements had no significant effect on body weight in adults.

In addition, a study of 32 obese adults found that taking fish oil supplements for 6 months had no significant effect on body weight or fat mass.

In summary, there is not enough evidence to suggest that fish oil supplements can help people gain weight.

<h2>Risks and Benefits of Fish Oil for Weight Gain</h2>

Although there is not enough evidence to suggest that fish oil supplements can help people gain weight, there are some potential risks and benefits associated with taking them.

<h3>Risks</h3>

Fish oil supplements can interact with certain medications, such as blood thinners, so it’s important to talk to a doctor before taking them. In addition, some people may experience side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal discomfort.

<h3>Benefits</h3>

Fish oil supplements can provide some health benefits, even if they don’t help with weight gain. They are a source of omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for human health. Omega-3 fatty acids have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease, stroke, and some types of cancer. In addition, fish oil supplements may help reduce inflammation, which can help reduce symptoms of certain conditions, such as arthritis and asthma.
