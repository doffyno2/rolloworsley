<p>Dog treats are a popular way to reward and bond with your pup, but can they make a human sick? The answer is yes, in some cases dog treats can make humans sick. In most cases, it’s not the food itself that’s harmful, but the way it’s handled. Despite the fact that dogs are often considered part of the family, their diets are different from ours and not all food that’s safe for them is safe for us. In this article, we’ll explore the potential risks of eating dog treats and how to keep you and your pup safe.</p>

<h2>What’s in a Dog Treat?</h2>

<p>Most dog treats are made with a combination of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Typically, the ingredients are chosen to be both nutritious and tasty. Some treats contain added sugar or artificial sweeteners, while others may contain more natural ingredients. Many dog treats also contain preservatives, flavor enhancers, and other additives.</p>

<p>Some types of dog treats, such as rawhide chews, can also be a potential choking hazard. These treats should be given to dogs with close supervision and should never be given to young children. Additionally, some dog treats may contain ingredients that can be toxic to humans like xylitol, which is found in some sugar-free treats.</p>

<h2>Can Eating Dog Treats Make You Sick?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes, eating dog treats can make you sick. Generally, this is not because of the ingredients in the treat itself, but due to the way it’s handled. Dog treats are often handled with bare hands, which can introduce bacteria into the food. Additionally, the treats may not have been kept at the correct temperature or stored properly, leading to the growth of bacteria.</p>

<p>In some cases, the bacteria present in the treat can make you sick. This is especially true if you have a weakened immune system or certain health conditions. Additionally, certain ingredients, such as xylitol, can be toxic to humans if consumed in large quantities.</p>

<h2>How to Keep Yourself Safe</h2>

<p>The best way to keep yourself safe is to not consume dog treats. If you do handle dog treats, make sure to do so with clean hands and wash them after handling. Additionally, store treats in a cool, dry place away from household pets and children. Finally, make sure to check the ingredients for any potential allergens or toxic ingredients.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, it is possible for humans to get sick from eating dog treats. This is typically due to improper handling or storage of the treats and not necessarily the ingredients themselves. To stay safe, it is best to not consume dog treats and to always handle them with clean hands. Additionally, store them in a cool, dry place away from pets and children and check the ingredients for any potential allergens.</p>
