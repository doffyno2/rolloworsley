<p>When it comes to keeping kosher, there is a great deal of confusion about which foods are acceptable to consume and which are not. One of the most commonly misunderstood areas of kosher food is fish. Is fish considered meat or dairy? Are there any fish that are not kosher? What is the difference between kosher fish and non-kosher fish?</p>

<p>In order to answer these questions, it is important to understand what makes a food kosher. Kosher foods are those that comply with the dietary laws of Judaism. These laws are outlined in the Torah, which is the Jewish holy book. According to these laws, a food must meet certain requirements in order to be considered kosher. For example, it must be slaughtered in a certain way and must not contain any forbidden ingredients, such as pork or shellfish.</p>

<p>When it comes to fish, the rules are slightly different. According to Jewish law, any fish that has both fins and scales is considered kosher. This includes most types of fish, such as salmon, cod, mackerel, haddock, and herring. However, there are a few exceptions, such as eels, sturgeon, and swordfish, which are not considered kosher.</p>

<p>In addition to having fins and scales, a fish must also be slaughtered in a certain way in order to be considered kosher. This is known as shechita, and it is a process that involves cutting the throat of the animal in a specific manner. This ensures that the animal is killed quickly and humanely.</p>

<p>It is important to note that while fins and scales are required for a fish to be considered kosher, there are some types of seafood that are not considered kosher. This includes shellfish, such as shrimp and lobster, as well as crabs and other crustaceans. These animals do not have fins and scales, and so they are not considered kosher.</p>

<p>In addition to the restrictions on certain types of seafood, there are also certain types of preparation that must be followed in order for a fish to be considered kosher. For example, any fish that is fried must be fried in oil that has been specially designated as kosher. Furthermore, any fish that is served with dairy products must be prepared in a separate area from the dairy products.</p>

<h2>Are Kosher Fish Fish That First?</h2>

<p>The answer to this question is yes. Any fish that has both fins and scales is considered kosher, regardless of where it is caught. Therefore, it is possible to find kosher fish in both freshwater and saltwater environments. Additionally, the same rules and regulations apply to both wild-caught and farmed fish.</p>

<p>It is important to note, however, that there are a few exceptions to these rules. For example, sturgeon and swordfish do not have scales, so they are not considered kosher. Additionally, some types of seafood, such as shrimp and lobster, are not considered kosher at all. It is important to check with a reliable source to ensure that the fish you are purchasing is indeed kosher.</p>
