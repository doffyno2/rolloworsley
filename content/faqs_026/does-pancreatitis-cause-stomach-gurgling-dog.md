When the pancreas becomes inflamed, it can’t produce enough of these enzymes, leading to digestive issues. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis is a sudden, short-term inflammation of the pancreas. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term inflammation of the pancreas that can be more serious.
