<p>Fishing is one of the most popular outdoor activities in the United States, and salt water fishing is a favorite among many anglers. Whether you are a novice or an experienced fisherman, salt water fishing can provide an enjoyable and rewarding experience. However, before you can go salt water fishing, you must make sure you have the correct permits and licenses. But does a Sportsman License cover salt water fishing?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is both yes and no. The Sportsman License is a generic term that can refer to a variety of different types of fishing licenses. Some of these licenses do cover salt water fishing, while others do not. It is important to know which type of license you need before you go fishing in salt water.</p>

<p>The most common type of Sportsman License that covers salt water fishing is the Recreational Saltwater Fishing License. This type of license is available to both residents and non-residents of the United States and is required for anyone who wants to fish in the ocean, bays, and estuaries of the United States. This license is valid for 365 days and allows anglers to keep up to five fish per day. Fishing for certain species, such as tarpon, may require an additional permit.</p>

<p>In addition to the Recreational Saltwater Fishing License, some states also offer an Angler’s License which covers both fresh and salt water fishing. This license is typically more expensive than the Recreational Saltwater Fishing License, but it does cover both types of fishing. Some states also offer a Combination License which covers both fresh and salt water fishing and hunting. Again, this license is typically more expensive than the single-purpose licenses.</p>

<p>It is important to note that many states also offer special licenses and permits for certain types of salt water fishing. For example, some states may require a special permit for lobster fishing, shark fishing, or other types of fishing. In addition, some states may require a special license for fishing in certain areas, such as estuaries, marshes, and bays. Before you go salt water fishing, be sure to check with your local fish and wildlife department to find out what type of license or permit you need.</p>
