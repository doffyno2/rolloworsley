Sushi is a type of Japanese cuisine that is becoming increasingly popular around the world. It consists of small pieces of raw fish, vegetables, and rice that are rolled up in seaweed or wrapped in a thin omelet. One of the most iconic components of sushi is the small orange things that are usually served alongside it. But what exactly are these orange things? 

<h2>What are the Orange Things on Sushi?</h2>

The orange things that are commonly served with sushi are called tobiko, or flying fish roe. Tobiko is a type of fish egg that is harvested from certain species of flying fish. The eggs are small, crunchy, and have a salty, smoky flavor that is slightly sweet. Tobiko is often served on top of sushi rolls or inside of them, adding a unique flavor and texture. 

<h2>What are the Benefits of Eating Tobiko?</h2>

In addition to adding flavor and texture to sushi, tobiko is also a nutritious food. It is high in protein, vitamins, and minerals, and also contains good amounts of omega-3 fatty acids. Eating foods that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids can help to reduce inflammation in the body, which can help to reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases. 

<h2>How is Tobiko Prepared?</h2>

Tobiko is usually prepared by marinating the eggs in a mixture of soy sauce and mirin, a sweet rice wine. This marinade helps to enhance the flavor of the eggs and also helps to preserve them. The eggs are then dried in the sun and then packaged for sale. 

<h2>What are the Different Types of Tobiko?</h2>

There are several different types of tobiko that are available in stores. The most common type is the orange variety, which is the type that is usually served with sushi. Other varieties include green tobiko, which is usually flavored with wasabi, and black tobiko, which is flavored with squid ink. 

<h2>How Should Tobiko Be Stored?</h2>

Tobiko should be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator. If properly stored, it can last up to a month. It is also important to keep the container away from direct sunlight, as this can cause the eggs to spoil. 

<h2>Can Tobiko Be Cooked?</h2>

Tobiko can be cooked in a variety of ways. It can be added to soups and stews, or used as a topping on salads and other dishes. It can also be deep-fried, which will give it a crunchy texture. 

<h2>What are Some Other Uses for Tobiko?</h2>

In addition to being eaten as part of sushi, tobiko can also be used in other dishes. It can be mixed into sauces and dips, or used as a garnish on dishes such as omelets and tempura. It can also be used in sushi rolls, as it adds a crunchy texture to the roll.
