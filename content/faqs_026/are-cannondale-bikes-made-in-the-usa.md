<p>Cannondale is a renowned American bike manufacturer that has been producing quality bicycles since 1971. The company is based in Bethel, Connecticut, and has a global presence in more than 60 countries. It is known for its innovative designs, advanced materials, and cutting-edge technologies that make its bikes some of the best performing and most reliable on the market.

In this article, we'll take a closer look at the company's production process, and answer the question: are Cannondale bikes made in the USA?</p>

<h2>Cannondale's Manufacturing Process</h2>

<p>Cannondale's manufacturing process is divided into two phases: design and production.

This allows the company to create products that are optimized for performance and durability, and also allows it to quickly and efficiently make adjustments to the design if needed. Once the design is finalized, the production phase begins. This involves sourcing the necessary materials and components, and assembling them into complete bikes.</p>

<p>For many years, Cannondale has produced the majority of its bikes in the USA. The company's main production facility is located in Bethel, Connecticut, and is where the majority of its higher-end bikes are produced. However, in recent years, the company has also begun to produce some of its lower-end bikes overseas in countries such as China, Taiwan, and Vietnam. This is done to reduce costs, as it is more cost-effective to produce these bikes in lower-cost countries.</p>
