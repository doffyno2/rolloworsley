<p>The Anglerfish is one of the most sought-after fish in Old School RuneScape (OSRS). It’s not only highly prized for its rare drops, but also for its ability to grant the player the Angler outfit, which gives additional fishing experience. The Anglerfish can be caught in several locations in OSRS, but most players choose to fish for them at the Fishing Colony. This guide will offer advice on how to fish for Anglerfish efficiently and what to do with them after they’ve been caught.</p>

<h2>Where to Find Anglerfish in OSRS</h2>

<p>The Fishing Colony is the best place to catch Anglerfish in OSRS. It is located in the northeast corner of the Lumbridge Swamp, which can be accessed by using a Fairy Ring code ALS. The Fishing Colony is a fairly large area with a few fishing spots, so it’s important to bring a few fishing rods with you to make fishing faster. A small fishing net is also recommended for catching baitfish in the area. It’s important to note that the Fishing Colony is a multi-combat area, so it’s important to bring friends or your best armor if you plan to fish there.</p>

<p>In addition to the Fishing Colony, Anglerfish can also be caught at the Fishing Guild and at Barbarian Village. The Fishing Guild is a members-only area, so it’s not recommended for non-members. Barbarian Village is a free-to-play area, however, so it’s a good spot for non-members to try their luck at catching Anglerfish. It’s important to note that Barbarian Village is a multi-combat area, so it’s important to bring friends or your best armor if you plan to fish there.</p>

<h2>What Bait to Use for Anglerfish</h2>

<p>The best bait to use for Anglerfish in OSRS is a sea turtle. Sea turtles can be found in the Fishing Colony and can be caught using a small fishing net. Sea turtles can also be bought from the Grand Exchange for a fairly low price. It’s important to note that sea turtles can only be used as bait for Anglerfish, so it’s important to have enough sea turtles on hand when fishing for Anglerfish.</p>

<h2>How to Fish for Anglerfish</h2>

<p>Once you have your fishing rod and sea turtles, you’re ready to start fishing for Anglerfish. To catch an Anglerfish, you’ll need to bait your fishing rod with your sea turtle, then cast your line. When you feel a tug on the line, you’ll need to reel in your line quickly. If you’re successful, you’ll have an Anglerfish on your line. It’s important to note that Anglerfish can be quite elusive, so it may take several attempts to catch one.</p>

<h2>What to Do with Anglerfish</h2>

<p>Once you’ve caught an Anglerfish, you’ll have several options for what you can do with it. The most common option is to cook the Anglerfish and eat it. Anglerfish can be cooked with level 80 Cooking and can heal up to 1600 life points when eaten. The Anglerfish can also be traded with other players or sold on the Grand Exchange for a small profit.</p>
