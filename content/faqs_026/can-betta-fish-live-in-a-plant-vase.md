<p>Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are very popular aquarium pets due to their vibrant colors and hardy nature. Despite their popularity, many people are unsure if betta fish can live in a plant vase. The answer is yes, but there are some important factors to consider before doing so.</p>
