<p>In Texas, a repo man can cut a lock if they are given permission from the legal owner of the vehicle. The law in Texas states that a repo man can take any action necessary to take possession of a vehicle, including the use of force, if the owner does not voluntarily relinquish the vehicle. This includes the use of a lock-cutter or other tool to forcibly open the lock.</p>

<p>It is important to note that a repo man cannot do anything that would be considered illegal, such as breaking into a vehicle or damaging property. The law does not allow for a repo man to use a lock-cutter to forcibly open a lock without permission from the legal owner of the vehicle. In addition, it is illegal for a repo man to use any type of force or intimidation to gain access to a vehicle.</p>

<p>If a repo man is given permission by the legal owner to cut a lock, then they can do so. The repo man must have a valid court order or writ of repossession in hand to use a lock-cutter and take possession of the vehicle. They must also provide proof of the legal ownerâ€™s permission before they can use a lock-cutter. If the repo man does not have a valid court order or writ of repossession, then the repo man cannot legally use a lock-cutter.</p>
