<h2>Is it Safe?</h2>

Robitussin is a popular over-the-counter medication used to treat a range of respiratory illnesses, including bronchitis, asthma, and allergies. While it is generally safe for humans, it is not recommended for use in dogs. Many dogs are sensitive to the active ingredients in Robitussin, which can cause dangerous side effects.

<h2>What Are the Active Ingredients in Robitussin?</h2>

Robitussin contains two active ingredients: dextromethorphan and guaifenesin. Dextromethorphan is an antitussive medication that is used to suppress coughs. Guaifenesin is an expectorant that helps thin and loosen mucus in the airways, making it easier to cough up phlegm.

<h2>What Are the Side Effects of Robitussin in Dogs?</h2>

Using Robitussin in dogs can cause a number of side effects, including vomiting, diarrhea, excessive thirst, restlessness, and panting. If the dog has a pre-existing medical condition or is taking any other medications, the side effects can be even more serious. In some cases, Robitussin can cause seizures or even death.

<h2>What Are the Alternatives to Robitussin?</h2>

If your dog is suffering from a respiratory illness, there are safer alternatives to Robitussin. Speak to your veterinarian about medications that are specifically formulated for dogs. These medications are much safer and more effective than Robitussin.

<h2>What Should I Do if My Dog Has Taken Robitussin?</h2>
