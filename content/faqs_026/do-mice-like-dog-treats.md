<p>Mice and rats are often thought to be similar animals, but they are actually quite different. Mice are small rodents that are often considered to be pests, while rats are larger rodents that are often kept as pets. Despite their differences, both species enjoy certain types of food, such as dog treats. But do mice like dog treats?</p>
