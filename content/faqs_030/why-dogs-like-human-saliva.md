<p>The most obvious reason why dogs like human saliva is because of its taste. Human saliva contains a variety of chemicals, such as enzymes, hormones, and proteins, that give it a certain flavor.

The taste of human saliva may be similar to that of other dog-friendly foods, such as meat and bones, which further explains why dogs are so drawn to it. </p>

<h2>The Smell of Human Saliva</h2>

<p>In addition to the taste, dogs also seem to respond positively to the smell of human saliva. Human saliva contains pheromones, which are chemicals that are released in order to attract a mate. Dogs are incredibly sensitive to pheromones, and may be drawn to the scent of human saliva for this reason. </p>

<h2>The Comfort of Human Saliva</h2>

<p>Finally, it's possible that dogs simply enjoy the comfort of human saliva. Dogs are social animals, and their owners often provide them with comfort and security.
