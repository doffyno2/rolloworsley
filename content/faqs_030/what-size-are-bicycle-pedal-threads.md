Bicycle pedal threads are one of the most important components of your bike's drivetrain. Not only do they provide a secure connection between the pedals and the frame, but they are also the primary interface between your feet and the bike. As such, having the correct thread size is essential for a smooth and efficient ride. In this article, we'll look at the different sizes of bicycle pedal threads, and why it's important to get the correct size for your bike.

<h2>Types of Bicycle Pedal Threads</h2>

Bicycle pedal threads come in three main sizes: 9/16", 1/2" and 14mm. The most commonly used size is 9/16" and it is used on most modern bicycles. The 1/2" size is less common and is typically used on older bikes, while the 14mm size is used mainly on BMX and mountain bikes.

<h2>Why Is It Important to Use the Correct Size?</h2>

Using the correct size of bicycle pedal threads is essential for a good cycling experience. It is important to ensure that the pedals are properly connected to the frame and that the thread is not too tight or too loose. 

A tight thread can make it difficult to remove the pedals from the frame, and a loose thread can cause the pedals to become loose and unsafe. Using the wrong size of thread can also cause damage to the frame or the pedals themselves.

In addition, using the wrong size of thread can make it difficult to keep your feet on the pedals, as the pedal will not be securely connected to the frame. This can lead to an uncomfortable ride, as well as an increased risk of slipping off the pedals.

<h2>How to Measure Bicycle Pedal Threads</h2>

Measuring the size of your bicycle pedal threads is quite simple. All you need is a ruler or tape measure. To measure your pedals, take off the left pedal and measure from the outside of the thread to the end of the thread. 

If the measurements are 9/16” then you have a 9/16” thread. If the measurements are 1/2” then you have a 1/2” thread, and if the measurements are 14mm then you have a 14mm thread.

<h2>How to Replace Bicycle Pedal Threads</h2>

If you find that you have the wrong size of bicycle pedal thread, then you will need to replace it with the correct size. The easiest way to do this is to purchase a new set of pedals with the correct size of thread. You can then simply unscrew the old pedals and replace them with the new ones.

It is also possible to replace the thread without purchasing new pedals, however this requires more skill and knowledge. To do this you will need to purchase a new set of threads as well as the appropriate tools, such as a tap and die set.
