Igloos are one of the most fascinating and iconic structures of the Arctic. They have been used by the Inuit people for centuries as temporary shelters during their nomadic lifestyle. But why don't they melt?

The answer to this question lies in the way an igloo is constructed and insulated. The shape of the igloo is the key to its temperature regulation. Its curved walls are designed to create a dome-like structure that can trap heat inside, while the entrance is kept small and low to the ground so that heat canâ€™t escape.

<h2>How Igloos are Constructed</h2>

Igloos are built from blocks of snow and ice. The blocks are stacked on top of each other in a spiral pattern, with each layer overlapping the one below it. This creates a dome-like structure with curved walls that are insulated by the snow.

The entrance is generally kept small and low to the ground to reduce the amount of heat that can escape. The blocks of snow and ice are held together using a combination of snow, ice, and water. The water is used to freeze the blocks together, creating an airtight seal that helps to keep the warmth inside.

<h2>How Igloos are Insulated</h2>

In addition to the airtight seal created by the blocks of snow and ice, igloos are also insulated by the snow itself. The thick layers of snow act as a barrier against the cold outside air and help to keep the temperature inside the igloo stable.

The snow is also porous, meaning that it absorbs heat from the inside of the igloo and traps it inside. This creates a warm and comfortable environment, even in the middle of winter.

<h2>How Igloos are Ventilated</h2>

Igloos are also designed to provide ventilation. This is done by cutting a small hole in the roof of the igloo, which allows fresh air to circulate inside. The air is warmed by the people and animals inside the igloo, and the warm air is then drawn out of the top of the igloo by the cold air outside.

This process helps to keep the temperature inside the igloo comfortable and prevents it from becoming too hot or too cold.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is an igloo?</h3>
An igloo is a dome-like structure made from blocks of snow and ice. It is used as a temporary shelter by the Inuit people in the Arctic.

<h3>How is an igloo built?</h3>
Igloos are built by stacking blocks of snow and ice in a spiral pattern, with each layer overlapping the one below it. Water is used to freeze the blocks together, creating an airtight seal.

<h3>How is an igloo insulated?</h3>
Igloos are insulated by the thick layers of snow and ice, which act as a barrier against the cold outside air. The snow is also porous, meaning that it absorbs heat from the inside of the igloo and traps it inside.

<h3>How is an igloo ventilated?</h3>
Igloos are ventilated by cutting a small hole in the roof of the igloo, which allows fresh air to circulate inside. The air is warmed by the people and animals inside the igloo, and the warm air is drawn out of the top of the igloo by the cold air outside.

<h3>What temperature does an igloo stay at?</h3>
An igloo can stay at a comfortable temperature even in the middle of winter. The thick layers of snow act as a barrier against the cold outside air and help to keep the temperature inside the igloo stable.

<h3>Can an igloo melt?</h3>
An igloo can melt if it is exposed to direct sunlight. The snow and ice blocks are not designed to withstand direct sunlight and will eventually start to melt if left in the sun for too long.

<h3>How long does an igloo last?</h3>
An igloo can last for several weeks or months, depending on the weather conditions and how well it is constructed.

<h3>What are some other uses of an igloo?</h3>
Igloos can also be used as a storage area or as a shelter for animals. They can also be used as temporary shelters in areas where there is no other shelter available.

<h3>What is the difference between an igloo and an ice cave?</h3>
The main difference between an igloo and an ice cave is that an igloo is made out of blocks of snow and ice, while an ice cave is carved out of solid ice. Igloos are also designed to provide insulation and ventilation, while an ice cave does not provide these features.

<h3>What is the average size of an igloo?</h3>
The average size of an igloo is around 8 feet (2.4 meters) in diameter and 4-6 feet (1.2-1.8 meters) in height.

<h3>What type of materials are used to build an igloo?</h3>
The materials used to build an igloo are blocks of snow and ice, as well as water to freeze the blocks together.

<h3>What is the purpose of an igloo?</h3>
The purpose of an igloo is to provide a temporary shelter in cold climates. They are designed to provide insulation and ventilation, as well as a warm and comfortable environment even in the middle of winter.
