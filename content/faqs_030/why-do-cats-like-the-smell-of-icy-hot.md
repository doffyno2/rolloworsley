Cats have a unique sense of smell and it’s one of the things that makes them so fascinating to us. One of the odors that cats really seem to like is the smell of icy hot. It’s a little-known fact that cats are attracted to the smell of icy hot, but why is that?

<h2>What Is Icy Hot?</h2>

Icy Hot is a topical pain reliever and muscle relaxant. It’s often used to relieve minor muscle aches and pains and is available in a variety of forms, including a cream, gel, spray, and roll-on. It’s typically applied to the skin and has a strong, minty smell that many people find pleasant.

<h2>Why Do Cats Like The Smell Of Icy Hot?</h2>

There are a few theories as to why cats seem to be attracted to the smell of icy hot. One of the most popular theories is that cats are attracted to the strong minty smell. Cats have an excellent sense of smell and the strong smell of icy hot may be pleasing to them.

Another theory is that cats are attracted to the warmth of the product. Icy hot is usually applied to the skin and when it’s applied, it creates a warming sensation. This warmth may be appealing to cats, especially on cold days.
