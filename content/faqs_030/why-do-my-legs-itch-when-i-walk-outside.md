<p>Walking outside on a pleasant day can be invigorating and a great way to get some exercise. But for some, a walk outside can be accompanied by an uncomfortable itchy sensation in their legs. This can be a source of distress and is often difficult to pin down the cause of the itching.</p>

<p>There are a few potential causes for itchy legs when walking outside. The first is an allergic reaction to something in the environment, such as pollen or plants. Other potential causes include insect bites, dry skin, and skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. Here, we explore the most common causes of itchy legs when walking outside.</p>

<h2>Allergic Reactions</h2>

<p>Insect bites are another potential cause of itchy legs when walking outside. Mosquitoes, ticks, and other bugs can bite your legs, leaving behind an itchy welts. These welts can be small and localized or cover a larger area of your leg. Insect bites usually appear as red bumps that can be painful or itchy.</p>
