<p>Meat tenderizer is a common kitchen ingredient that is used to break down proteins, making tougher cuts of meat more tender. But is it safe for dogs to consume? Many pet owners may not know the answer to this question, so we are here to shed some light on the subject.</p>

<p>First of all, it is important to understand that meat tenderizer is available in two different forms â€“ powdered and liquid. Powdered meat tenderizers often contain monosodium glutamate (MSG) as well as other additives, while liquid meat tenderizers are often composed of enzymes such as papain, bromelain, and ficin. These enzymes are derived from plants, animals, and fungi, and can help break down proteins.</p>

<h2>Can Dogs Eat Meat Tenderizer?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes, dogs can eat meat tenderizer, but it is important to take some precautions. The first and most important precaution to take is to make sure that the meat tenderizer you are using does not contain MSG. MSG is known to be toxic to dogs, and can cause symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, and even seizures.</p>

<p>If you are using a powdered or liquid meat tenderizer that does not contain MSG, it is safe for dogs to consume. However, there are a few things to keep in mind. First, meat tenderizer should only be used in moderation. Too much meat tenderizer can cause gastrointestinal upset, so use it sparingly when preparing food for your dog.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is important to note that meat tenderizer should only be used on raw meats. Cooking meat with tenderizer can cause the proteins to break down too much, leading to a mushy texture. If you are looking for a way to tenderize cooked meats, try marinating them in a vinegar-based marinade.</p>
