<p>Fast travel is a feature in video games that enables players to quickly move from one location to another, usually across long distances. Fast travel is most often used in open-world games, where the player can explore large and often detailed game worlds. It has become a staple of modern video game design, allowing players to save time and effort when travelling around the game world. But what was the first game to introduce fast travel?</p>

<p>The answer is <b>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</b>, which was released in 2002. Released on the Xbox, PC and later the PlayStation 2, Morrowind was the third installment of the popular Elder Scrolls series. It was the first game in the series to introduce the concept of fast travel. Players could purchase a map from a guild hall or temple, then select a destination on the map and instantly teleport there. The concept of fast travel was revolutionary at the time, and it has been featured in almost every Elder Scrolls game since then.</p>

<p>The concept of fast travel was not exclusive to Morrowind. Several other games had already implemented some form of fast travel before Morrowind, but none of them had done it in a way that was as comprehensive and user-friendly as Morrowind. For example, the original Ultima Online, released in 1997, featured a system of teleportation runes which could be used to travel around the game world. However, this system was not as intuitive or user-friendly as the fast travel system in Morrowind.</p>

<p>Morrowind's fast travel system has been copied and improved upon by many other games since then. For example, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3 both featured similar fast travel systems, allowing players to quickly and easily travel around their game worlds. The concept has become so ubiquitous that it is now expected by players of open-world games. Many games, such as Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2, feature fast travel systems that are more intuitive, user-friendly and comprehensive than Morrowind's.</p>

<h2>How Does Fast Travel Work?</h2>

<p>A game's fast travel system typically works by allowing the player to purchase or find a map of the game world. Players can then select a destination on the map and instantly teleport there. In some games, such as Grand Theft Auto V, players can also purchase special items or upgrade their cars to enable fast travel. Other games, such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, feature special portals or transportation networks which allow players to quickly move around the game world.</p>

<p>Fast travel is an invaluable tool for players of open-world games. It allows them to save time and effort when travelling around the game world, which can be especially helpful for exploration-focused games such as The Elder Scrolls series. It also allows players to quickly revisit areas of interest, such as cities, dungeons or quest objectives. In some games, such as Fallout 3, fast travel is also used to move between different areas of the game world, such as from one city to another.</p>
