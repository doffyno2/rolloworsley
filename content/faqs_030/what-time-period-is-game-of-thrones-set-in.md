<p>Game of Thrones is one of the most popular television series of all time. The show is based on George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire novel series, which is set in a fictional world known as Westeros. The world of Westeros is a feudal society, meaning that it is divided into a hierarchy of social classes. The kingdom is divided into several regions, with each region having its own unique culture and traditions. But what time period is Game of Thrones set in?</p>

<p>The answer to this question is complicated, as the show’s creators have provided few clues as to the exact time period in which the series is set. While there are no definitive answers, it is possible to make some educated guesses based on clues from the books and the show. Here, we’ll discuss the time period in which Game of Thrones is set and explain why it is so difficult to pinpoint.</p>

<h2>The Timeline of Westeros</h2>

<p>The timeline of Westeros is established in the books, and is referred to as “The Long Night”. This is a period of time in which a mysterious darkness descended upon the world and lasted for an entire generation. During this time, the world was divided into seven independent kingdoms. After the Long Night, the Seven Kingdoms were united by Aegon the Conqueror, who established the Targaryen dynasty.</p>

<p>The events of the series take place after the Targaryen dynasty has been in power for several centuries. The timeline is established in the books as “the Age of Heroes”, which is a period of time in which the Seven Kingdoms were united under a single ruler. It is during this period of time that many of the events of the series take place.</p>
