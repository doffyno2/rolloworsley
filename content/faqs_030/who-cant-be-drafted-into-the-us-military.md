<p>The United States military is one of the most powerful forces in the world, and it relies on a steady stream of recruits to keep it functioning. But who can be drafted into the US military?</p>

<p>In general, the only people who can be drafted into the US military are citizens and permanent residents between the ages of 18 and 25. This is because the US military draft is dependent upon the Selective Service System, which is a federal agency that maintains a list of those eligible to be drafted. This means that individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents of the United States, or those who are over the age of 25, are not eligible for the draft.</p>

<p>In addition, those who are eligible for the draft must also meet certain criteria in order to be considered for service. These criteria include passing a physical examination, being mentally and physically fit for military service, not having any criminal history, and having no medical conditions that would prevent them from serving. Those who do not meet the criteria will not be considered for the draft.</p>

<h2>Who Is Exempt From the Draft?</h2>

<p>Some individuals are exempt from the draft. These include people with certain medical conditions, those who have registered for conscientious objector status, and those who are in certain educational institutions or in certain occupations. In addition, individuals who are already serving in the military or are in certain other government positions may also be exempt.</p>

<h2>What Are the Consequences of Not Registering?</h2>

<p>It is important to note that, regardless of whether or not an individual is eligible for the draft, all males between the ages of 18 and 25 must register for the Selective Service. Failure to register can result in a variety of penalties, including fines, loss of federal financial aid, and even jail time. Therefore, it is important for all eligible individuals to register with the Selective Service System as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>What Happens If You Are Drafted?</h2>

<p>If an individual is drafted, they will be required to report to the nearest induction center. At the induction center, they will be given a physical examination and will be asked to sign up for basic training. If they pass the physical and sign up for basic training, they will be officially inducted into the military. After basic training, they will be assigned to a specific branch of the military and will begin their military career.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Serving in the Military?</h2>

<p>Serving in the military can have many benefits, both during and after a person's service. These benefits may include medical and dental care, educational opportunities, retirement benefits, and job training. Additionally, many veterans receive preferential treatment when applying for jobs, as well as other benefits from the government.</p>
