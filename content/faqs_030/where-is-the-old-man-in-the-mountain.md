The Old Man in the Mountain is a symbol of mystery, strength and beauty that has been inspiring generations since the mid-18th century. For centuries, the Old Man of the Mountain, or Grandfather of the Mountains, has been a source of fascination for people all over the world. 

Located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, the Old Man of the Mountain is a rock formation created by glacial erosion and located on the side of Mount Cannon. It was first discovered in 1805 by two surveyors working for the state of New Hampshire, and soon became an iconic symbol of the state. 

<h2>What is the Old Man in the Mountain?</h2>
The Old Man of the Mountain is a granite cliff face that has been weathered and eroded over time, forming a face-like profile. It is located on the western side of Mount Cannon, in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. 

The Old Man of the Mountain stands at an elevation of 5,073 feet (1,547 m), and is composed of five granite ledges that form a face that is roughly 40 feet (12 m) wide and 25 feet (7.6 m) high. The ledges that form the Old Man's face are each about two feet (0.6 m) thick and are composed of a very hard granite that has resisted erosion better than the softer rock around it. 

<h2>History of the Old Man in the Mountain</h2>
The Old Man of the Mountain was first discovered by two surveyors, Levi Thaxter and Luke Brooks, who were hired by the state of New Hampshire to survey the area in 1805. Thaxter wrote in his diary that they first saw the Old Man of the Mountain while they were descending a mountain and thought it resembled a face. 

The formation quickly became a symbol of the state of New Hampshire, appearing on its state quarter and license plates. The formation was also an inspiration for many of the state's buildings, including the New Hampshire State Library and New Hampshire State House. 

<h2>The Legend of the Old Man in the Mountain</h2>
The Old Man of the Mountain has been an important part of New Hampshire's culture for centuries. It is said that the formation was created by a mountain spirit who was watching over the state and protecting its citizens. The spirit was said to be a giant man with a long, white beard who was so tall that he could touch the clouds. 

The spirit was said to be a protector of the state, but he was also said to have a dark side. He was said to be the cause of strange occurrences, such as mysterious lights and strange sounds. 

<h2>The Collapse of the Old Man in the Mountain</h2>
In 2003, the Old Man of the Mountain collapsed due to a combination of factors, including erosion, freezing and thawing, and heavy rains. The collapse was sudden and dramatic, and the formation has not been seen since. 

Since the collapse, the state of New Hampshire has erected a memorial to the formation, and the face of the Old Man of the Mountain is still seen on the state quarter and license plates.
