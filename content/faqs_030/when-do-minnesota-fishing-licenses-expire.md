<p>Fishing is a great way to relax and enjoy the outdoors, and Minnesota has some of the best fishing spots in the country. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced angler, you’ll need a valid fishing license to legally fish in the state. But when do Minnesota fishing licenses expire?</p>

<p>In Minnesota, a fishing license is valid for one year from the date of purchase. All anglers age 16 and older must purchase and carry a valid fishing license at all times when fishing in Minnesota. Licenses can be purchased online, by phone, or in person at any DNR license agent or DNR office. </p>

<p>Fishing licenses are available for both residents and nonresidents of Minnesota. The fees for a Minnesota fishing license vary depending on the type of license and whether you are a resident or nonresident. Residents can buy an annual fishing license for $22.50, while nonresidents will pay $52.50. </p>

<p>Children under the age of 16 do not need a fishing license, but they must be accompanied by an adult with a valid fishing license. Anglers with disabilities may be eligible for a fee reduction on their fishing license. </p>

<h2>Minnesota Fishing License Expiration Date</h2>

<p>All Minnesota fishing licenses expire one year from the date of purchase. You may purchase a fishing license at any time during the year, and it will be valid until the date printed on the license. It is important to check the expiration date on your license when you purchase it so you can keep track of when it will expire. </p>

<p>Your fishing license does not need to be renewed each year. Once you purchase a license, it will remain valid until the date printed on the license. However, if you want to continue fishing beyond the expiration date, you will need to purchase a new license. </p>

<h2>License Renewal</h2>

<p>If you already have a valid fishing license and want to renew it for another year, you can do so online or by phone. To renew online, simply log in to your account and select the "Renew License" option. You will be required to enter your license number and payment information. Once your payment is processed, your license will be renewed for another year. </p>

<p>If you do not have an online account, you can renew your license by phone. Simply call the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources at 651-296-6157 and provide your license number and payment information. Your license will then be renewed for another year. </p>

<h2>Replacing a Lost Fishing License</h2>

<p>If you have lost or misplaced your fishing license, you can easily replace it by purchasing a duplicate license. Duplicate licenses can be purchased online, by phone, or in person at a DNR license agent or DNR office. The cost of a duplicate license is the same as a regular fishing license. </p>

<p>When purchasing a duplicate license, you will need to provide your license number and payment information. Once your payment is processed, you will receive a new license with the same expiration date as your original license. </p>
