<p>The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, is the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the Earth's surface. It is the process by which water moves from the Earth's surface to the atmosphere and back again. The water cycle is powered by energy from the sun and gravity, and it is responsible for the distribution of water around our planet.</p>

<p>Water is constantly moving through the cycle, evaporating from the Earth's surface, condensing in the atmosphere, and returning to the Earth's surface as precipitation. This cycle is essential for life on Earth, as it helps to regulate the climate, maintain freshwater supplies, and transport nutrients and minerals around the globe.</p>

<h2>What are the Steps of the Water Cycle?</h2>

<p>The water cycle consists of four main steps: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Each step is essential for the cycle to continue.</p>

<h3>Evaporation</h3>

<p>Evaporation is the process by which liquid water is turned into vapor. This occurs when the liquid water is heated by the sun, causing it to evaporate. This vapor then rises and joins the air in the atmosphere, where it can be carried around the globe.</p>

<h3>Condensation</h3>

<p>Condensation is the process by which vapor is turned back into liquid water. This occurs when the vapor cools and forms clouds. The clouds then become heavy with water droplets and eventually release their water as precipitation.</p>

<h3>Precipitation</h3>

<p>Precipitation is the process by which liquid water is returned to the Earth's surface. This occurs when the clouds become so heavy with water droplets that they can no longer remain in the air and must release their water. This water can fall as rain, snow, or hail, depending on the temperature of the atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Runoff</h3>

<p>Runoff is the process by which water is returned to the ocean. This occurs when the water on the Earth's surface is unable to be absorbed into the ground and instead runs off into rivers, streams, and eventually the ocean.</p>

<h2>What are the Defining Characteristics of a Water Cycle?</h2>

<p>The defining characteristics of a water cycle are the four steps of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. These steps are essential for the cycle to continue, as they are responsible for the movement of water around the globe. Without these steps, water would not be able to move between the atmosphere, land, and oceans, and life on Earth would not be able to exist.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What are the defining characteristics of a water cycle?</h3>

<p>The defining characteristics of a water cycle are the four steps of evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. These steps are essential for the cycle to continue, as they are responsible for the movement of water around the globe.</p>

<h3>What is the importance of the water cycle?</h3>

<p>The water cycle is essential for life on Earth, as it helps to regulate the climate, maintain freshwater supplies, and transport nutrients and minerals around the globe.</p>

<h3>What is the source of energy for the water cycle?</h3>

<p>The water cycle is powered by energy from the sun and gravity.</p>

<h3>How does the water cycle affect plants?</h3>

<p>The water cycle is essential for plants, as it provides them with the water they need to survive. The process of evaporation helps to cool the air and provide water vapor for plants to absorb, while condensation and precipitation provide them with the liquid water they need to grow.</p>

<h3>How does the water cycle affect animals?</h3>

<p>The water cycle is essential for animals, as it provides them with the water they need to survive. The process of evaporation helps to cool the air, while condensation and precipitation provide them with the liquid water they need to stay hydrated.</p>

<h3>What is the role of the oceans in the water cycle?</h3>

<p>The oceans play an essential role in the water cycle, as they are the largest source of water on Earth. The oceans store much of the planet's water, and they are responsible for transporting water around the globe via currents and evaporation.</p>

<h3>What is the role of the atmosphere in the water cycle?</h3>

<p>The atmosphere plays an essential role in the water cycle, as it is responsible for carrying water vapor around the globe. The atmosphere also helps to condense water vapor into clouds, which eventually release their water as precipitation.</p>
