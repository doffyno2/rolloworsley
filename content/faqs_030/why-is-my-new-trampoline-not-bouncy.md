<p>If you’ve recently purchased a trampoline and are frustrated that it’s not quite as bouncy as you’d like, we understand your disappointment. Nothing is quite as fun as a trampoline with a great bounce, and it’s always a bummer when that’s not quite what you get. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to help make sure your trampoline is as bouncy as possible.</p>

<h2>What Affects a Trampoline’s Bounce?</h2>

<p>A trampoline’s bounce is affected by several factors. The size of the trampoline, the type of material it’s made of, and the condition of the springs all play a role in how bouncy your trampoline is. Let’s take a closer look at each of these factors. </p>

<h3>Trampoline Size</h3>

<p>Trampolines come in a variety of sizes, from small circular trampolines to large rectangular trampolines. Generally speaking, the bigger the trampoline the more bouncy it will be. That’s because larger trampolines have more springs and more surface area, which means more bounce. If you’re looking for a trampoline with a great bounce, go for a larger size.</p>

<h3>Material</h3>

<p>The type of material your trampoline is made of can also affect its bounce. Trampolines are typically made of either metal or polypropylene. Metal trampolines tend to be more bouncy than polypropylene trampolines, but they are also heavier and more expensive. Polypropylene trampolines are lighter and usually less expensive, but they don’t tend to bounce as high. </p>

<h3>Condition of the Springs</h3>

<p>The condition of the springs is probably the most important factor when it comes to a trampoline’s bounce. If the springs are rusty or worn, they won’t be able to provide enough tension to create a good bounce. You should regularly check the condition of your trampoline’s springs and replace them as needed. If you notice that your trampoline’s bounce is decreasing, it may be a sign that the springs need to be replaced.</p>

<h2>Tips for Improving Your Trampoline’s Bounce</h2>

<p>Once you’ve identified the factors that are affecting your trampoline’s bounce, you can take steps to improve it. Here are a few tips for making your trampoline bouncier:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Clean the Springs:</b> Make sure your trampoline’s springs are clean and free of rust or dirt. A clean spring will provide more tension and help create a better bounce.</li>
  <li><b>Check the Mat:</b> Inspect the trampoline mat for any tears or holes. If the mat is torn, it won’t be able to provide the same amount of springiness and the bounce won’t be as good.</li>
  <li><b>Replace the Springs:</b> If the springs are old or worn out, it’s time to replace them. New springs will provide more tension and help create a better bounce.</li>
  <li><b>Add Weight:</b> If your trampoline is lightweight, you can add a few extra pounds to it to help create a better bounce. Just make sure you don’t overdo it.</li>
  <li><b>Adjust the Tension:</b> Many trampolines come with adjustable tension settings. Try adjusting the tension settings to see if it helps improve the bounce.</li>
</ul>
