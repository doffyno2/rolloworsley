<p>Flomax is a prescription medication used to treat the symptoms of an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH). It belongs to a class of medications known as alpha-adrenergic blockers, which help to relax the muscles of the bladder and prostate. This can help to reduce urinary symptoms, such as difficulty starting urination, a weak urine stream, and a feeling that the bladder is not completely empty. Flomax can also help to reduce the risk of needing surgery to treat BPH.</p>

<h2>How Does Flomax Work?</h2>

<p>Flomax works by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors in the bladder and prostate, which relaxes the muscles and allows the bladder to empty more easily. It also helps to reduce the risk of needing surgery to treat BPH. Flomax is not a cure for BPH, but it can help to reduce the symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

<h2>When Should I Take Flomax?</h2>

<p>Flomax is typically taken once daily, with or without food, usually in the morning. It is important to take Flomax exactly as prescribed by your doctor, and to not stop taking it suddenly without discussing it with your doctor first.
