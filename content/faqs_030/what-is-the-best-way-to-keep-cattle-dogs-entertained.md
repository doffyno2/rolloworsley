Cattle dogs are a type of herding dogs that have been bred specifically for herding livestock. They have an intense drive, as well as a keen understanding of the animals they herd. As such, they can be great companions for anyone who wants an active and intelligent pet. However, these dogs need to be kept entertained in order to remain healthy and happy. Here are some ideas for how to keep your cattle dog entertained.

<h2>Provide Plenty of Exercise</h2>
Exercise is one of the most important aspects of keeping your cattle dog entertained. Cattle dogs are working dogs, and they need plenty of physical activity in order to stay healthy, both mentally and physically. Take your cattle dog for walks, hikes, jogs, and swims. If you have a large enough yard, you can also let them run around and play. Make sure to provide plenty of mental stimulation for your dog as well, such as teaching them new tricks or playing hide-and-seek.
