<h3>Keep Your Dog Inside</h3>

If you can, keep your dog inside your home or a secure building. This way, pillagers won't be able to get to your dog.

<h3>Put Your Dog On A Lead</h3>

If you need to take your dog outside, make sure to put it on a lead. This will keep your dog close and make it easier to protect it from pillagers.

<h2>Can You Kill Pillagers?</h2>
