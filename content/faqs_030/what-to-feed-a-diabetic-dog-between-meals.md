Caring for a diabetic dog can be a challenge, but with the proper nutrition and management, your pet can lead a happy and healthy life. If your pup is diabetic, it’s important to know what to feed them between meals—this will help maintain their blood sugar levels and keep them feeling their best. In this article, we’ll discuss what to feed a diabetic dog between meals and provide advice on how to ensure your pup gets the nutrition they need.

<h2>What Is Diabetes in Dogs?</h2>

Diabetes is a chronic condition in which the body does not produce enough insulin, or the cells become resistant to it, causing elevated blood sugar levels. Diabetes can lead to various health issues, including vision problems, urinary tract infections, and organ damage. It’s important to catch and treat diabetes in dogs as soon as possible—if left untreated, the condition can be life-threatening.

Good snacks for diabetic dogs include lean proteins like boiled chicken, boiled eggs, and cooked turkey. You can also give your pup low-fat plain yoghurt, cottage cheese, and plain cooked fish.

When it comes to carbohydrates, it’s important to stick to high-fiber, low-sugar options. Good snacks for diabetic dogs include boiled sweet potatoes, cooked rolled oats, and plain cooked brown rice.
