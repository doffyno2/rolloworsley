<p>Pivot Cycles is a mountain bike manufacturer based in Phoenix, Arizona. The company, which was founded in 2007, produces a range of high-end mountain bikes, including hardtails, full-suspension bikes, and downhill bikes. Pivot bikes are widely available in bike shops throughout the United States and Canada, as well as in select countries around the world. While the company is based in the United States, the majority of Pivot bikes are actually manufactured in Taiwan.</p>

<h2>History of Pivot Cycles</h2>

<p>Pivot Cycles was founded by Chris Cocalis in 2007. Chris had previously worked as a product manager at Titus Cycles and Marzocchi Suspension, and had been a mountain bike racer for over 15 years. After starting Pivot, Chris and his team quickly set out to develop a range of mountain bikes that could compete with the industry's top brands. The company's first bike, the Mach 4, was released in 2008 and was widely praised for its innovative design and superior performance.</p>

<h2>How Are Pivot Bikes Made?</h2>

<p>Pivot bikes are designed and developed in Phoenix, Arizona, however the manufacturing process is outsourced to factories in Taiwan. The company works with a number of Taiwanese factories that specialize in metal fabrication, welding, and assembly. All of the raw materials used to construct Pivot bikes are sourced from Taiwan as well.</p>

<p>Once the bikes are designed and the materials are sourced, the manufacturing process begins. The frames are welded together using a combination of robotic and manual welding techniques. The frames are then inspected and tested for strength and rigidity. After passing inspection, the frames are powder-coated and then put through a series of finishing processes which includes sanding, polishing, and anodizing. The frames are then assembled with the other components, including suspension, brakes, drivetrain, and wheels.</p>

<p>Once the bikes are assembled, they are put through a rigorous testing process to ensure that they meet Pivot's high quality standards. The company tests each bike for durability, stiffness, and ride quality. Any bikes that do not meet the company's standards are sent back to the factory for re-work.</p>

Pivot bikes are also backed by a lifetime warranty, which is a testament to the company's commitment to quality.</p>
