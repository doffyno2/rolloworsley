Yorkie Terriers are a small, energetic breed of dog that have become increasingly popular over the years. Many people may not be aware, however, that these dogs are actually a hybrid breed, which means they are a combination of two different breeds. So what two breeds make up a Yorkie Terrier?

<h2>What is a Yorkie Terrier?</h2>

Yorkie Terriers, or “Yorkies” as they are commonly known, are a hybrid breed of dog, meaning they are a cross between two different breeds. Yorkies are usually small in size, with an average weight of 7 to 8 pounds and a maximum height of 8 to 10 inches. They have a long, silky coat, which can come in a variety of colors including black and tan, silver, chocolate, and even white. Yorkies are energetic and outgoing, making them great companions and family dogs.

<h2>The Breeds That Make Up a Yorkie Terrier</h2>

Yorkie Terriers are a hybrid breed, meaning they are a combination of two different breeds. The two breeds that make up a Yorkie Terrier are a Yorkshire Terrier and a Maltese. Yorkshire Terriers were developed in the 19th century in Yorkshire, England, and were originally bred to catch rats and other small rodents. They are small, but feisty and brave, with a long, silky coat that can be black and tan, silver, or chocolate in color. 

Maltese were originally bred in the Mediterranean region, and have been around for hundreds of years. They are small dogs with a white coat that is usually long and silky. Maltese are gentle and affectionate, and known for being great lap dogs.

<h2>Characteristics of a Yorkie Terrier</h2>

Due to their mix of Yorkshire Terrier and Maltese genetics, Yorkie Terriers inherit many of the characteristics of both breeds. They are usually small in size, with a maximum height of 8 to 10 inches, and an average weight of 7 to 8 pounds. Their coat is usually long and silky, and can come in a variety of colors including black and tan, silver, chocolate, and even white. 

Yorkie Terriers are energetic, outgoing, and brave, making them great companions and family dogs. They are also intelligent and easy to train. They need to be groomed regularly to keep their coat in good condition, as well as to prevent mats and tangles. Yorkie Terriers also need a moderate amount of exercise, and can be taken on daily walks or played with in the yard.

<h2>Are Yorkie Terriers Right for You?</h2>

Yorkie Terriers make great companions and family dogs, but they may not be the right breed for everyone. They require regular grooming to keep their coat in good condition, as well as a moderate amount of exercise each day. They are also small in size, so they may not be suitable for active households with small children. 

Overall, Yorkie Terriers are a great breed for families looking for an affectionate and outgoing companion. However, it’s important to make sure you are prepared to meet the needs of this breed before committing to owning one.
