<p>Most dog owners have probably noticed that their pup’s nails tend to split, crack or break over time. This can be a cause for concern, as it can lead to painful paws and nails that can be difficult to treat. But why do dogs’ nails split in the first place? And what can you do to help prevent or treat it? Read on to learn more about why your dog’s nails are splitting and what you can do about it.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Dog’s Nails to Split?</h2>

<p>There are several potential causes of nail splitting in dogs. One of the most common is overgrowth. If a dog’s nails are not trimmed regularly, they can become too long and start to split. This is especially true for breeds with long, curved nails, such as schnauzers, shih tzus and poodles.</p>

<p>In addition, dogs who are active outdoors can experience a lot of wear and tear on their nails, which can cause them to split. Dogs who jog, hike, or play in the dirt and sand are especially prone to this. The friction caused by running across rough surfaces can cause the nails to break or tear.</p>

<p>Finally, certain medical conditions can cause a dog’s nails to split. Fungal or bacterial infections can cause the nails to become brittle and break easily. In addition, some dogs may have a genetic predisposition to brittle nails.</p>

<h2>How to Prevent Nail Splitting</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent nail splitting in dogs is to keep their nails trimmed regularly. This will help ensure that the nails do not become too long and start to split. If your dog is active outdoors, it’s also a good idea to trim the nails a bit shorter than usual to help prevent them from breaking.</p>

<p>In addition, if you notice your dog’s nails are starting to split, you should take them to the vet to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be causing the issue.</p>

<h2>How to Treat Nail Splitting</h2>

<p>If your dog’s nails are already splitting, there are a few things you can do to help. First, trim the nails as short as possible to reduce the risk of further splitting. You should also apply a moisturizing balm or cream to the nails to help them heal. If the nail splitting is severe, your vet may suggest using a topical antibiotic cream or ointment.</p>

<p>Finally, if the nail splitting is caused by a fungal or bacterial infection, your vet may prescribe an oral or topical antifungal or antibiotic to help treat the infection. In severe cases, the vet may need to surgically remove the nail.</p>
