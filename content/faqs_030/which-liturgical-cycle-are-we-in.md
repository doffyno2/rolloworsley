Many people are familiar with the liturgical year, the Christian cycle of observances or celebrations that mark certain times throughout the year. But what does the liturgical cycle actually refer to? In this article, we'll explore the Christian liturgical year, how it is determined and where we are in the cycle today.

<h2>What Is the Liturgical Year?</h2>

The liturgical year is a cycle of seasons, each with its own significance and importance. This cycle is based on the events of Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection. It is divided into two main sections: the Christmas season and Easter season. The Christmas season typically begins on the fourth Sunday before Christmas and lasts until Epiphany, which is celebrated on January 6th. The Easter season begins on Ash Wednesday and lasts until Pentecost, which is celebrated on the Sunday 50 days after Easter.

<h2>What Are the Different Seasons of the Liturgical Year?</h2>

The liturgical year is made up of four main seasons. The first is Advent, which is the four weeks leading up to Christmas. During Advent, we prepare for the coming of Jesus Christ. The second season is Christmas, which is celebrated from Christmas Day until Epiphany. During this season, we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ. The third season is Lent, which is the six weeks leading up to Easter. During Lent, we focus on repentance and preparation for the coming of Easter. The fourth season is Easter, which is celebrated from Easter Sunday until Pentecost. During Easter, we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
