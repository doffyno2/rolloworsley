<p>Coyotes are notorious for their ability to adapt to various habitats and survive in the wild. They are often seen as a nuisance by humans and can be a danger to both people and their pets, but coyotes also have a vital place in the natural order. One of the most common questions about coyotes is whether they will eat dry dog food that is left outdoors.  </p>

<p>The answer to this question is yes, coyotes will eat dry dog food if it is left out in the open. Coyotes are opportunistic feeders, meaning they will eat whatever food is available.
