Saltines, also known as soda crackers, are a type of thin, square, unsalted cracker. They are typically made with white flour, yeast, vegetable oil, and baking soda, and are light and crisp. Saltines are a popular snack in the United States and have been around for over a century.

<h2>History of Saltines</h2>

Saltines were first produced in 1876 by the F.L. Sommer & Company in St. Joseph, Missouri. The company was founded by German immigrant Frederick Lorenz Sommer, and the first production of saltines was done in a small brick building in downtown St. Joseph. 

The Sommer & Company was the first in the United States to commercially produce saltines, and they quickly became a popular snack. People were attracted to the light and crispy texture of the crackers, as well as the fact that they were unsalted. This made them a healthier alternative to other salty snacks.

By the late 19th century, saltines had become so popular that they were sold in tins at grocery stores and pharmacies. The tins were often decorated with images of lakes and sailing ships, which added to their appeal. 

<h2>Saltine Production</h2>

In order to make saltines, a dough is prepared using white flour, yeast, vegetable oil, and baking soda. This dough is rolled out and cut into thin, square crackers. The crackers are then placed on a baking sheet and baked in an oven.

Once the crackers are baked, they are then salted with a mixture of table salt and baking soda. This mixture gives the crackers their distinctive salty flavor. The crackers are then cooled and packaged for sale.

<h2>Modern Saltine Production and Uses</h2>

Today, saltines are still produced in the same manner as they were in the 19th century. The main difference is that many modern recipes call for the addition of sugar and other flavorings to give the crackers a sweeter taste.

Saltines are still a popular snack in the United States and are often served with soups, salads, and other dishes. They are also used in various recipes, such as casseroles, dips, and desserts.
