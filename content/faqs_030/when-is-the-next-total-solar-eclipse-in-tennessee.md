<p>A total solar eclipse is one of the most amazing astronomical events an individual can witness. For a few short minutes, the entirety of the sun’s light is blocked out, the sky darkens, and the stars can be seen during the day. While this is an impressive natural phenomenon, the timing and location of a total solar eclipse can be hard to predict. This article will explore the next total solar eclipse in Tennessee, its timing, and what to expect when it arrives.</p>

<h2>What Is a Total Solar Eclipse?</h2>

<p>A total solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the Earth, blocking out all but a small portion of the sun’s light. During a total solar eclipse, the moon’s shadow will create a path of totality, meaning that the area within the path will experience complete darkness for a few minutes. It is important to note that a total solar eclipse is different from a partial solar eclipse, which occurs when only a portion of the sun is blocked out by the moon. During a partial solar eclipse, the sky will only darken slightly and the stars will not be visible.</p>

<h2>When Is the Next Total Solar Eclipse in Tennessee?</h2>

<p>The next total solar eclipse in Tennessee will take place on April 8, 2024. The eclipse will start around 2:48 PM EDT and will last until 5:09 PM EDT. The path of totality will span across the states of Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. In Tennessee, the eclipse will be visible along a 70-mile path stretching from Memphis in the west to Chattanooga in the east.</p>

<h2>What Should You Expect?</h2>

<p>During the total solar eclipse in Tennessee in 2024, the sky will darken and the stars will become visible. It is important to note that the darkness will only last for a few minutes, so it is important to be prepared. It is also important to take safety precautions to protect your eyes, as looking directly at the sun without proper protection can cause permanent damage.</p>

<p>The view of the eclipse will also be affected by weather conditions. If it is cloudy or raining, it is unlikely that the eclipse will be visible. To increase the chances of a clear view, it is recommended that individuals travel to an area with a higher elevation and less cloud coverage.</p>

<h2>What Are the Best Places to View the Eclipse in Tennessee?</h2>

<p>The best places to view the eclipse in Tennessee are areas with high elevations, such as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The park is home to some of the highest peaks in the Appalachian Mountains and offers stunning views of the eclipse from its many lookout points. Other ideal spots include Lookout Mountain in Chattanooga, which offers unparalleled views of the eclipse, and the Obed Wild and Scenic River in Morgan County, which is known for its secluded and peaceful atmosphere.</p>

<h2>What Else Should You Know?</h2>

<p>The total solar eclipse in Tennessee in 2024 will be visible to the naked eye, but it is recommended that individuals purchase eclipse glasses for an optimal viewing experience. It is also important to note that there will be a partial eclipse before and after the total eclipse. During these times, it is important to use proper eye protection.</p>

<p>It is also important to make sure that you are in the path of totality during the eclipse.
