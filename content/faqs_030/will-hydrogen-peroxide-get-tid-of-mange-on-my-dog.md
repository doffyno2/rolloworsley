<p>Mange is a skin condition caused by mites and is a common problem in dogs. These mites can cause intense itching, hair loss, and inflamed, crusty skin. While it can be treated with medication, many owners have had success in treating their pup’s mange with hydrogen peroxide. But before we dive into that, let’s explore what exactly causes mange and how to determine if your pup is suffering from it.</p>

<h2>What Causes Mange?</h2>

<p>Mange is caused by microscopic mites that live on the skin of dogs. These mites can be divided into two main categories - demodectic and sarcoptic. Demodectic mites live in the hair follicles of most dogs. However, if a dog has a weakened immune system or other health problems, these mites can multiply quickly and cause skin irritation and general discomfort. On the other hand, sarcoptic mites are more contagious and can be spread through contact with other animals. They can also live on other surfaces like bedding, furniture, and carpets.</p>

<h2>How To Determine If Your Dog Has Mange</h2>

<p>The most common symptom of mange is intense itching. Your pup may also have patches of hair loss, red and inflamed skin, scabs, and a strong odor. If your pup is suffering from mange, it’s important to seek professional help. Your vet can diagnose and treat mange with the appropriate medications.</p>

<h2>Can Hydrogen Peroxide Get Rid of Mange?</h2>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide is an oxidizing agent that can be used to treat mange. It works by killing the mites that cause the condition. However, it should not be used as a substitute for professional veterinary care. You may also want to consider using a topical solution containing benzoyl peroxide, which can help soothe the skin and reduce itching.</p>

<h2>How to Use Hydrogen Peroxide to Treat Mange</h2>

<p>If you choose to use hydrogen peroxide to treat your pup’s mange, it’s important to use it as directed. Start by mixing one part hydrogen peroxide with one part water. Then, apply the solution to your pup’s skin with a cotton ball or gauze pad. Let the solution sit on your pup’s skin for at least 10 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water. Repeat the process once or twice a day until the mange has cleared up.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Side Effects to Using Hydrogen Peroxide?</h2>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide can be an effective treatment for mange, but it can also cause side effects. These include skin irritation, redness, and itching. If your pup experiences any of these side effects, discontinue use of the hydrogen peroxide and contact your veterinarian.</p>

<h2>Preventing Mange in the Future</h2>

<p>Once your pup’s mange has been treated, it’s important to take steps to prevent it from returning. The best way to do this is by keeping your pup’s environment clean and free of mites. Vacuum carpets and furniture regularly, and make sure to wash your pup’s bedding in hot water. Additionally, it’s important to keep your pup’s immune system healthy and to feed them a balanced diet.</p>
