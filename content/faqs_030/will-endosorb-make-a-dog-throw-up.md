Endosorb is a popular veterinary medication often prescribed to dogs to help treat stomach issues and vomiting. The medication is designed to reduce the symptoms of gastrointestinal upset and to help even out the stomach's pH balance. Endosorb can be a helpful tool in managing a dog's vomiting, but it is important to understand how it works, what it can do, and any potential side effects before giving it to your pet.

<h2>What Is Endosorb?</h2>

Endosorb is a type of medication known as a buffered solution. It is composed of a combination of sodium bicarbonate and magnesium hydroxide. The buffering action of the medicine helps to neutralize stomach acid and restore the natural pH balance in the stomach. As a result, it can help reduce the symptoms associated with gastrointestinal upset, such as vomiting and diarrhea. 

<h2>How Does Endosorb Work?</h2>

Endosorb works by neutralizing the acid in the stomach. This helps to reduce the symptoms of gastrointestinal upset, such as vomiting and diarrhea. The medication also helps to reduce the amount of gas in the stomach, which can help reduce bloating and discomfort. Endosorb works quickly and is often given in liquid form to help the dog absorb it more quickly.
