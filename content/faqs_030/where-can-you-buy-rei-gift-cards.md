<p>If you’re looking for the perfect gift for the outdoor enthusiast in your life, a REI gift card is a great choice. REI, or Recreational Equipment, Inc., is an outdoor retail store that offers a wide selection of camping, hiking, cycling, and other outdoor gear. With a REI gift card, the lucky recipient can choose from the vast selection of items available in the store and online.</p>

<p>REI gift cards can be purchased online, in-store, or through third-party websites. Depending on the method of purchase, there are a few different ways to go about getting a REI gift card. In this article, we’ll go over everything you need to know about where to buy REI gift cards and how to use them.</p>

<h2>Where to Buy REI Gift Cards?</h2>

<p>You can purchase REI gift cards online, in-store, or through third-party websites. The easiest way to buy an REI gift card is online. You can choose to have the gift card sent electronically to the recipient, or you can print the gift card and give it to them in person. To purchase a gift card online, simply visit the REI website and select “Gift Cards” from the main menu. You can then select the amount of the gift card you’d like to purchase and proceed to checkout.</p>

<p>You can also purchase REI gift cards in-store. Head to your local REI store and look for the gift card rack. You can purchase a physical gift card in any denomination, or you can purchase an electronic gift card that will be emailed to the recipient. The advantage of purchasing an in-store gift card is that you can choose from a variety of designs and add a personal message.</p>

<p>Finally, you can purchase REI gift cards through third-party websites such as Amazon, eBay, and Raise. These websites often offer discounted cards, so it’s worth checking to see if you can get a better deal. Keep in mind that you may have to wait for the physical card to arrive in the mail, so you’ll need to allow for extra time if you’re planning on using it right away.</p>

<h2>How to Use REI Gift Cards?</h2>

<p>Once you’ve purchased an REI gift card, you’ll need to activate it before you can use it. To activate a physical gift card, you’ll need to enter the 16-digit code on the back of the card. To activate an electronic gift card, you’ll need to enter the 16-digit code provided in the email. Once the card is activated, you can use it to shop at any REI store or on the REI website.</p>

<p>When using an REI gift card, you’ll need to enter the 16-digit code at checkout. If your purchase exceeds the amount on the card, you’ll need to pay the difference with another form of payment. If your purchase is less than the amount on the card, the remaining balance will stay on the card and can be used for future purchases.</p>
