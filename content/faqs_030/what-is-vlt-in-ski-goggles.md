Ski goggles are an essential piece of equipment for skiing, snowboarding, and other winter sports. In order to ensure optimum visibility, it’s important to choose a pair of goggles that have the right VLT (Visible Light Transmission) for the conditions. But what is VLT and how does it affect the performance of your ski goggles?

<h2>What is VLT?</h2>

VLT stands for Visible Light Transmission, and it refers to the amount of visible light that passes through a lens and into your eyes. The higher the VLT, the more light that is allowed to pass through the lens and the brighter the image appears. This can be an advantage in low-light conditions, such as night skiing or snowboarding, or in flat-light conditions with low contrast.

<h2>How Does VLT Affect Your Ski Goggles?</h2>

The VLT of your ski goggles has a direct impact on your visibility on the slopes. The higher the VLT, the more light is allowed to pass through the lens, resulting in a brighter image and improved visibility. A higher VLT is ideal for low-light conditions, such as night skiing or snowboarding, or in flat-light conditions with low contrast. However, in sunny conditions, a higher VLT can cause the image to appear washed out and may make it difficult to distinguish terrain features, such as bumps and dips.

<h2>What is the Ideal VLT for Ski Goggles?</h2>

The ideal VLT for your ski goggles depends on the conditions you’ll be skiing or snowboarding in. If you’re skiing or snowboarding in low-light conditions, such as night skiing or snowboarding, or in flat-light conditions with low contrast, you’ll want to choose goggles with a higher VLT. If you’re skiing or snowboarding in sunny conditions, you’ll want to choose goggles with a lower VLT. 

<h2>How to Choose the Right VLT for Your Ski Goggles</h2>

When choosing your ski goggles, it’s important to choose the right VLT for the conditions. Most ski goggles will have a VLT rating listed on the label, ranging from 0-100%. To choose the right VLT, consider the following:

<h3>Low Light Conditions</h3>

If you’re skiing or snowboarding in low-light conditions, such as night skiing or snowboarding, or in flat-light conditions with low contrast, choose goggles with a higher VLT, such as 70%-90%.

<h3>Sunny Conditions</h3>

If you’re skiing or snowboarding in sunny conditions, choose goggles with a lower VLT, such as 10%-30%.
