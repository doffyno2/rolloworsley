<p>Triathlons are an incredibly popular sport that combines swimming, biking, and running into one event. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, understanding the order of a triathlon is essential for success.</p>

<h2>What is a Triathlon?</h2>

<p>A triathlon is a multi-sport event that consists of three continuous and sequential endurance races: swimming, biking, and running. Triathlons are raced over various distances, ranging from sprint to ultra-distance.</p>

<h2>Types of Triathlon Races</h2>

<p>The most popular type of triathlon is a sprint-distance triathlon, which typically consists of a 750-meter swim, a 20-kilometer bike ride, and a 5-kilometer run. Other common types of triathlons are Olympic-distance triathlons (1.5-kilometer swim, 40-kilometer bike ride, 10-kilometer run), 70.3-distance triathlons (1.2-mile swim, 56-mile bike ride, 13.1-mile run), and 140.6-distance triathlons (2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, 26.2-mile run).</p>

<h2>What is the Order of a Triathlon?</h2>

<p>The order of a triathlon is swim-bike-run. The swim leg is typically the first segment of the race, followed by the bike leg and then the run leg. Depending on the type of race, the order of the legs may change, but the swim is always first and the run is always last.</p>

<h2>Swim Leg</h2>

<p>The swim leg is the first segment of any triathlon race. This can range in distance depending on the type of race, but typically consists of a 750-meter swim. The swim leg is typically done in open-water, such as a lake or ocean, but can also be done in a pool. During the swim, competitors must follow a predetermined course and are not allowed to use any swim aids, such as fins, paddles, or wetsuits.</p>

<h2>Bike Leg</h2>

<p>The bike leg is the second segment of a triathlon race. This can range in distance depending on the type of race, but typically consists of a 20-kilometer bike ride. During the bike leg, competitors must follow a predetermined course and are allowed to use any type of bicycle. Some races may also include a transition from the swim to the bike, which requires competitors to quickly change from a swimsuit to cycling clothes without stopping.</p>

<h2>Run Leg</h2>

<p>The run leg is the final segment of a triathlon race. This can range in distance depending on the type of race, but typically consists of a 5-kilometer run. During the run leg, competitors must follow a predetermined course and are not allowed to use any type of running aid, such as running shoes or ankle weights.</p>

<h2>Transitions</h2>

<p>In addition to the swim-bike-run order of a triathlon, competitors must also complete two transitions between the swim and bike and the bike and run legs. The transitions are timed, as well as the individual legs, and are designed to simulate a real-world triathlon environment where competitors must quickly and efficiently transition from one leg to the next. During the transitions, competitors must quickly change from a swimsuit to cycling clothes and then from cycling clothes to running clothes without stopping.</p>
