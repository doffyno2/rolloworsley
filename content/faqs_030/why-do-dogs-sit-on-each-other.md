Dogs are social animals that love to interact with each other. One of the ways they do this is through physical contact. Sitting on each other is one way that dogs show their affection and bond with one another. In this article, we'll discuss why dogs sit on each other, the benefits of this behavior, and how to ensure it's done safely.

<h2>Why Do Dogs Sit on Each Other?</h2>

Dogs sitting on each other is a behavior that can be seen in many different breeds and sizes. It's a display of dominance, affection, and even comfort.

Dogs that are dominant will often sit on other dogs to let them know they are the alpha. Sitting on another dog establishes the dominant dog's position in the pack. This behavior can also be seen in pet dogs that live in households with multiple dogs.

In addition to dominance, sitting on each other can also be a way for dogs to show affection. This behavior can be seen in both puppies and adult dogs. Dogs may sit on each other to show their love and bond with one another.

Finally, dogs may also sit on each other for comfort. This is especially common when one dog is feeling scared or anxious. The other dog may provide comfort and security by sitting on them.

<h2>Benefits of Dogs Sitting on Each Other</h2>

Dogs sitting on each other can provide a number of benefits. Not only does it help to strengthen the bond between dogs, it can also help to reduce stress and anxiety.

The act of sitting on each other can help to release calming hormones such as oxytocin. This can help to reduce stress and create a feeling of safety and security. This behavior is especially beneficial for puppies that are feeling scared or anxious.

Sitting on each other can also be beneficial for dominant dogs. Establishing dominance over another dog can help to reduce aggression and ensure that the pack is running smoothly.
