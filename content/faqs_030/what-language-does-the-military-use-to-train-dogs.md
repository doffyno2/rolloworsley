In this article, we will explore the language used to train military dogs.

<h2>What Kind of Dogs Does the Military Use?</h2>

The commands are usually given in a loud and clear voice in order to ensure the dog understands them. The commands should be given in a calm and patient tone, and the dog should be praised for obeying the commands.

<h2>What Other Types of Language Are Used?</h2>
