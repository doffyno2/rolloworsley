<p>If you are a Maryland resident who has recently filed your state income taxes, you may be wondering, “Where is my Maryland refund?” Knowing the answer to this question can help you plan for your financial future and ensure that your refund arrives on time. In this article, we will discuss the Maryland tax refund process, what happens when your refund is delayed, and how to check the status of your refund.</p>

<h2>The Maryland Tax Refund Process</h2>

<p>The Maryland Department of Revenue processes income tax returns and issues refunds. Generally, the Department will process and issue refunds within 8-10 weeks of filing your return. However, due to the volume of returns received, the refund process may take longer. In some cases, it can take up to 16 weeks for your refund to be processed and issued.</p>

<p>Once your return has been processed, your refund will be issued in the form of a mailed check or deposited directly into your bank account, depending on how you filed your return. If you filed electronically, you should receive your refund within 5-7 business days. If you filed a paper return, it may take up to 10-14 business days.</p>

<h2>What Happens When Your Refund is Delayed?</h2>

<p>In some cases, your refund may be delayed. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as if your return contains errors or if the Department needs to verify information on your return. When this happens, you will be notified by mail or email. You can also check the status of your refund online by visiting the Department’s website.</p>

<p>If your refund is delayed, it is important to remain patient and not make any unnecessary phone calls to the Department. The Department is unable to provide updates on individual refunds and will not be able to provide any additional information. The best course of action is to wait for your refund to be processed and issued.</p>

<h2>How to Check the Status of Your Refund</h2>

<p>You can check the status of your refund online by visiting the Department’s website. First, you will need to enter your Social Security number, date of birth, and the total amount of your refund. Once you have entered this information, you will be able to view the status of your refund. The website will also provide you with an estimated date of when your refund will be issued.</p>

<p>If you are unable to view the status of your refund online, you can also call the Department’s refund hotline at (410) 260-7980. The hotline is available from 8:00am to 4:30pm Monday through Friday. When you call the hotline, you will need to provide your Social Security number and the total amount of your refund.</p>
