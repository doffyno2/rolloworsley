<p>Cannondale is one of the most popular and beloved bike brands in the world, with a history of over 40 years. As one of the earliest producers of mountain bikes, Cannondale has been innovating and producing top-of-the-line bikes for decades. If you’re the proud owner of a Cannondale bike, you may be wondering when your bike was made and what year it is.<p>

<h2>How To Date Your Cannondale Bike</h2>

<p>Dating Cannondale bikes is a relatively straightforward process. Every Cannondale bike is stamped with an ID code that contains production information. This code is located on the underside of the bottom bracket, where the crank arms attach to the frame. Reading this code will tell you the year and production month of the bike.<p>

<p>The first two digits of the code indicate the year of production. For example, a code beginning with “19” indicates that the bike was made in 2019. The last two digits of the code indicate the production month. For example, a code ending with “06” indicates that the bike was produced in June. The code in between is the serial number.</p>

<p>For example, if a code reads “19 0606 0123”, then this bike was made in June 2019 with serial number 0123.</p>

<h2>What To Do If You Can't Find The ID Code</h2>

<p>If you can’t find the ID code, you can look for other signs that may indicate the year of production. Cannondale has changed its logos and decals over the years, so these can be used to indicate the age of the bike. If you’re still having trouble, you can also check the components and features of the bike. For example, if the bike has disc brakes, then you can narrow down the production date to after 2003.</p>
