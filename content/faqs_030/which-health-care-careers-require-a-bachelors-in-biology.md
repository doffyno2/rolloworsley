<p>A Bachelor's in Biology is a versatile degree that opens up a variety of career paths in the health care field. With a Bachelor's in Biology, you can pursue a career in a number of different areas, from becoming a doctor to a laboratory technician. Here, we explore the different health care careers that require a Bachelor's in Biology and how to get started in each of them.</p>

<h2>Physicians</h2>

<p>One of the most common and sought-after health care careers is that of a physician. Physicians, also known as doctors, are responsible for diagnosing and treating illnesses and injuries. They typically work in hospitals, clinics, or private practice. To become a physician, you must first complete a four-year Bachelor's in Biology, followed by four years of medical school. After medical school, you will need to pass a state-issued licensing exam before you can practice medicine.</p>

<h2>Physician Assistants</h2>

<p>Physician Assistants (PAs) provide medical care under the supervision of a licensed physician. PAs are educated in the medical model, meaning they are able to diagnose and treat illnesses, as well as order and interpret lab tests and imaging studies. To become a PA, you must first complete a Bachelor's in Biology, followed by a two-year PA program, and then pass a national certification exam. </p>

<h2>Laboratory Technicians</h2>

<p>Laboratory technicians are responsible for carrying out lab tests and experiments, as well as analyzing and interpreting the results. They typically work in hospitals, clinics, research laboratories, and other medical settings. To become a laboratory technician, you must first complete a Bachelor's in Biology, followed by a one-year laboratory technician program. </p>

<h2>Medical Scientists</h2>

<p>Medical scientists conduct research to improve healthcare and medical treatments. They typically work in research laboratories, universities, and other medical settings. To become a medical scientist, you must first complete a Bachelor's in Biology, followed by a two-year Master's program in a field such as biochemistry or molecular biology. </p>

<h2>Pharmacists</h2>

<p>Pharmacists are responsible for dispensing medications, advising patients on their use, and monitoring the effects of medications. To become a pharmacist, you must first complete a Bachelor's in Biology, followed by a four-year Doctor of Pharmacy program. After graduating from the Pharmacy program, you must pass a national licensure exam before you can practice pharmacy.</p>

<h2>Veterinarians</h2>

<p>Veterinarians are responsible for diagnosing and treating illnesses and injuries in animals.
