<p>When you're stuck in a rut and find yourself getting bored, it's natural to reach for something to eat to make the time pass. But with all the unhealthy snacks available, it can be hard to know what to eat when you're bored. Luckily, there are plenty of healthier options that can help satisfy your cravings without compromising your health.</p>

<h2>Healthy Snack Options</h2>

<p>The key to finding healthy snacks is to focus on foods that are rich in nutrients and low in sugar, fat, and calories. Some great options include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fresh fruits and vegetables</li>
    <li>Whole grain crackers and breads</li>
    <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
    <li>Low-fat yogurt and cottage cheese</li>
    <li>Hard-boiled eggs</li>
    <li>Air-popped popcorn</li>
    <li>Hummus and whole wheat pita</li>
</ul>

<p>These snacks are all rich in vitamins, minerals, and other important nutrients that can help fuel your body and keep you feeling energized. Plus, they're much more satisfying than processed snacks, so you're less likely to overeat.</p>

<h2>Other Considerations</h2>

<p>When choosing snacks, it's important to consider the nutritional value of the food. For example, some snacks may be low in fat and calories but still be high in sugar. Others may be high in protein but low in fiber. It's important to read labels and choose snacks that provide a good balance of nutrients.</p>

<p>It's also important to be mindful of portion size. Eating too much of even a healthy snack can lead to weight gain, so it's important to pay attention to how much you're eating. </p>
