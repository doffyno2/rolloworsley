Why Do You Need a Hiking Permit to Hike Mt St Helens?


Mount St. Helens is an active stratovolcano located in Skamania County, Washington, in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. It is 50 miles (80 km) northeast of Portland, Oregon, and 96 miles (154 km) south of Seattle, Washington. The volcano is located in the Cascade Range and is part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc, a segment of the Pacific Ring of Fire that includes over 160 active volcanoes. 

Mt. St. Helens is most famous for the large eruption that occurred on May 18, 1980. The eruption was a VEI 5 event, the largest in the contiguous United States in the 20th century. The blast destroyed the volcano’s summit and surrounding areas and left a large crater. 

<h2>Why Is a Hiking Permit Required?</h2>
Hiking Mount St. Helens requires a hiking permit. These permits are issued by the U.S. Forest Service and are intended to help manage the number of visitors to the area, as well as protect the fragile environment around the volcano. 

The permits are issued for day hikes only and are not required for activities such as camping, climbing, skiing, or snowshoeing. However, visitors should remember that those activities may require additional permits. 

The permits for day hikes are available for a fee of $19 per person. This fee covers the cost of issuing the permit, as well as the cost of maintaining the trails and other facilities in the area. It also helps to fund ongoing research and monitoring of the volcano and its effects on the environment.

<h2>Where to Obtain a Hiking Permit</h2>
The best place to obtain a hiking permit is online at recreation.gov. This is the official website of the U.S. Forest Service, and they offer permits for a variety of activities in the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument. 

The permits can also be obtained at the Mount St. Helens Visitor Center, located at the Johnston Ridge Observatory. The Visitor Center is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., seven days a week from mid-May through mid-October. 

Permits can also be obtained at the Marble Mountain Sno-Park and the Lone Fir Campground. The permits are valid for one day only, so if you plan to spend multiple days in the area, you will need to purchase additional permits. 

<h2>What is Included in a Hiking Permit?</h2>
A hiking permit for Mount St. Helens includes access to the trailhead and the area surrounding it for the day of the permit. The permit also includes access to the Johnston Ridge Observatory, which is located near the volcano’s summit. 

The permit does not include access to any other areas of the national monument. For example, the Ape Cave and the Loowit Trail are not included in the permit.
