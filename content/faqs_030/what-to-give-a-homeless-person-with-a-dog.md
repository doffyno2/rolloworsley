Homelessness is an issue that affects people across the world, and those with a dog can have a particularly difficult time. It can be hard to know what to give a homeless person with a dog, as they often can’t store and carry much, and need items that are both practical and lightweight. 

<h2>What Kinds of Items Can be Given to a Homeless Person With a Dog?</h2> 

When giving to a homeless person with a dog, it’s important to bear in mind that their needs will be different to someone without a pet. Practical items that are both lightweight and durable can be of real help.

<h3>Food and Water</h3> 

Food and water are essential for any homeless person, and those with a dog will need more of both. Foods that are easy to carry, store, and eat on the go, such as energy bars, canned goods, and sandwiches, are ideal. Water bottles that can be refilled easily are also essential for keeping both the person and the dog hydrated. 

<h3>Shelter and Warmth</h3>

Homeless people with a dog will need items to keep both of them warm and sheltered from the elements. Blankets, sleeping bags, coats, and boots can all be of use. 

<h3>Hygiene and First Aid</h3>

It is important to help homeless people maintain basic hygiene and keep their dogs healthy. Toiletries such as soap, toothpaste, and deodorant can all be useful, as well as pet items such as collars, leashes, and flea and tick treatments. Basic first aid items such as bandages, antiseptic cream, and pain relief can also be useful. 

<h3>Miscellaneous Items</h3>

Miscellaneous items can also be of use to a homeless person with a dog. Things like hats, scarves, and gloves can help protect them from the cold, and items such as garbage bags and plastic sheeting can help them to keep their belongings dry.

You can give directly to a homeless person with a dog. This can involve you providing items directly to the person, or leaving items in a public place where they are likely to find them. Make sure that the items you are giving are appropriate for the person and their pet.
