<h2>What Should I Look for When Buying a Fitbit?</h2>

<p>When buying a Fitbit, it’s important to make sure you get a device that’s in good condition. Look for signs of wear and tear, such as scratches or dents. Make sure the device is still under warranty and check the battery life. It’s also important to make sure the device is compatible with your phone or tablet.</p>

<h2>What Should I Do Before Selling My Fitbit?</h2>

<p>Before selling your Fitbit, it’s important to delete all of your personal data. This includes deleting any apps, contacts, and photos that are stored on the device.
