Kennel cough, also known as canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), is a common and highly contagious respiratory disease in dogs. It is caused by a combination of viruses and bacteria, and can cause severe coughing, sneezing, and gagging in infected dogs. While kennel cough can be a serious condition, it is usually mild and can be treated at home with some simple home remedies. One of the most important home remedies for a dog with kennel cough is providing a proper diet.

<h2>What is Kennel Cough?</h2>

Kennel cough is an infectious respiratory disease caused by a combination of viruses and bacteria. The most common viruses and bacteria associated with kennel cough are Bordetella bronchiseptica, Canine Parainfluenza virus, and Canine Adenovirus type 2. The disease is spread through contact with infected dogs, or through contact with contaminated items, such as food bowls and toys. 

When a dog is infected with kennel cough, he will usually show signs of coughing, sneezing, gagging, and nasal discharge. In some cases, the dog may also develop a fever and loss of appetite. The symptoms usually last for about two weeks, and in most cases, the dog will recover without any complications.

Vitamins such as vitamin A, C, and E are important for proper immune system functioning. Minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium are important for strong bones and teeth.
