When the temperatures start to climb, it's time to start thinking about what to wear. As the weather warms up, we all want to dress appropriately for the weather and look our best. But how do you know what to wear in degree weather? 

<h2>Layering Is Key</h2>

Layering is key when it comes to dressing for degree weather. You want to be able to take off or add layers as the day progresses and the temperature fluctuates. Opt for lightweight layers that won't be too heavy or bulky, but also provide enough warmth. A good option is a light cardigan or a thin jacket.

<h2>Choose Breathable Fabrics</h2>

When choosing what to wear in degree weather, it's important to opt for breathable fabrics. Choose materials that will keep you cool, such as linen, cotton, and lightweight wool. Avoid synthetic fabrics such as polyester, which can make you feel hot and sticky. You can also opt for lightweight, airy fabrics such as chiffon or silk. 

<h2>Opt for Light Colors</h2>

Light colors are often the best choice when dressing for degree weather. Light colors will reflect the sunlight and keep you cooler. Opt for white, ivory, pastel colors, and other light shades. Avoid dark colors, which can absorb the sunlight and make you feel hotter. 

<h2>Choose the Right Accessories</h2>

Accessories can also help keep you cool in degree weather. Choose a lightweight scarf or hat to keep the sun off your face. A lightweight scarf can also be used to cover your arms or legs if you're feeling too warm. Opt for lightweight sunglasses to keep the sun out of your eyes.

Make sure that the clothes fit properly and aren't too tight or too loose. You want to be able to move freely and feel comfortable in your clothes. 

<h2>Avoid Heavy Fabrics and Layers</h2>

When dressing for degree weather, it's best to avoid heavy fabrics and layers. Heavy fabrics, such as denim, can make you feel hot and uncomfortable. You should also avoid layering multiple items, as this can make you feel too warm.
