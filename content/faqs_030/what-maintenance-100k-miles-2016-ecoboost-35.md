<p>The 2016 EcoBoost 35 is a popular choice for those looking for a reliable, efficient, and powerful vehicle. This model is known for its fuel economy and its ability to provide a smooth and comfortable ride, even on long trips. However, like any vehicle, it requires regular maintenance to keep it running in top condition. In this article, we'll look at some of the maintenance tasks that you should perform after your EcoBoost 35 reaches 100,000 miles.</p>

<h2>Oil Change</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do when your EcoBoost 35 reaches 100,000 miles is to change the oil. Oil is the lifeblood of your engine, and it's important to keep it fresh and clean. Oil changes should be performed every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, but it's especially important to do so after your vehicle has reached this milestone. When having your oil changed, you should also consider upgrading to a synthetic oil, as it will help your engine run more efficiently and last longer.</p>

<h2>Spark Plugs</h2>

<p>Another important maintenance task you should perform after your EcoBoost 35 reaches 100,000 miles is to change the spark plugs. Spark plugs are responsible for igniting the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber, which is essential for proper engine operation. Replacing the spark plugs will help ensure that the engine is operating optimally and will help reduce emissions. It's important to use the correct spark plugs for your vehicle, so make sure you consult your owner's manual or a certified mechanic before replacing them.</p>

<h2>Air Filter</h2>

<p>The air filter in your EcoBoost 35 should also be replaced after it reaches 100,000 miles. A clogged air filter can cause your engine to run less efficiently, which can reduce fuel economy and increase emissions. A dirty air filter can also cause stalling and rough idling, so it's important to replace it on a regular basis. Make sure to use an OEM replacement filter, as an aftermarket filter may not fit properly and could cause additional issues.</p>

<h2>Coolant Flush</h2>

<p>In addition to the other maintenance tasks, you should also consider having a coolant flush performed on your EcoBoost 35 after it reaches 100,000 miles. Coolant is responsible for keeping your engine from overheating, and it should be replaced every two years or 30,000 miles. A coolant flush will remove any sediment that has built up in the system, which can cause corrosion and other issues. It's important to use the correct coolant for your vehicle, so make sure you check your owner's manual or consult a certified mechanic before performing the flush.</p>

<h2>Brake Fluid</h2>

<p>Finally, you should also consider having the brake fluid in your EcoBoost 35 changed after it reaches 100,000 miles. Brake fluid is responsible for providing the necessary pressure to the brake system, and it should be replaced every two years or 30,000 miles. A brake fluid flush will help ensure that your brakes are functioning properly and will help reduce the risk of brake failure. Be sure to use the correct brake fluid for your vehicle, as using the wrong type can cause serious damage.</p>
