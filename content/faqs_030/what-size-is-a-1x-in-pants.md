Clothing sizes can be confusing, especially when shopping online. Pants are even more complex because there are different measurements for waist, length, and hips. Understanding the sizing is essential for finding the perfect pair of pants that fit comfortably and look great.

<h2>What Does 1X Mean?</h2>

1X is a size in women's clothing that roughly corresponds to a US size 16W. It is usually a dress size, but some designers and stores also use it for bottoms like pants. 1X is considered to be a plus size, and is usually associated with larger sizes.
