<p>BMX bikes are lightweight, versatile machines that are used for racing, dirt riding, park riding, and street riding. A BMX bike uses a different type of chain than a standard mountain or road bike. The chain size is important to ensure that the bike is properly tuned and that it is compatible with other components on the bike.</p>

<h2>What is a BMX Chain?</h2>

<p>A BMX chain is a specialized type of chain designed specifically for BMX bikes. It is made from hardened steel and is designed to be stronger and more durable than a standard bicycle chain. The chain size is measured in whole and fractional inches, and the size of the chain must match the size of the sprocket on the bike.</p>

<h2>What Size Chains do BMX Bikes Use?</h2>

<p>BMX bikes typically use a chain size of 1/2 x 1/8 inches. This is the size of the chain used on most BMX bikes, and it is compatible with most BMX sprockets. This size of chain is sometimes referred to as “half link” or “half-inch” chain.</p>

<h2>How to Measure a BMX Chain</h2>

<p>Measuring a BMX chain is a simple process. The first step is to remove the chain from the bike. Then, measure the inner width of the chain links. The inner width is the distance between the two inner plates of the chain link. This measurement should be 1/2" (12.7mm). The second measurement is the distance between the outer plates of the chain link. This measurement should be 1/8" (3.175mm).</p>

<h2>Type of BMX Chains</h2>

<p>There are two common types of BMX chains: single-speed and multi-speed. Single-speed chains are designed for use with single-speed BMX bikes. These chains are designed for use with one sprocket and cannot be used with derailleurs. Multi-speed chains are designed for use with multi-speed BMX bikes. These chains are designed for use with multiple sprockets and can be used with derailleurs.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Using the Right Chain Size</h2>

<p>Using the right chain size is important for two reasons. First, using the wrong chain size can lead to problems with shifting and can cause the bike to be difficult to ride. Second, using the right chain size can help keep the bike running smoothly and efficiently.</p>

<h2>How to Choose the Right Chain Size</h2>

<p>When choosing a chain size, it is important to make sure that the chain size is compatible with the sprockets on the bike. Most BMX bikes come with a chain size of 1/2 x 1/8 inches, but it is important to check the size of the sprockets before purchasing a new chain. If the chain size is not compatible with the sprockets, the bike may not shift properly.</p>

<h3>Are there any other types of BMX chain?</h3>

<p>Yes, there are other types of BMX chains, such as half-link chains, rollerless chains, and heavy-duty chains. Half-link chains are designed for use with single-speed BMX bikes. Rollerless chains are designed for use with multi-speed BMX bikes. Heavy-duty chains are designed for use with extreme BMX riding.</p>

<h3>What should I do if my BMX chain has broken?</h3>

<p>If your BMX chain has broken, you should replace it with a new one as soon as possible. Before replacing your chain, make sure that the size of the new chain is compatible with the sprockets on your bike. You should also check that the new chain is of good quality and has been properly lubricated.</p>

<h3>How often should I replace my BMX chain?</h3>

<p>It is recommended that you replace your BMX chain every 500 miles. You should also check your chain for wear and tear every few months and replace it as soon as any signs of wear and tear become visible.</p>
