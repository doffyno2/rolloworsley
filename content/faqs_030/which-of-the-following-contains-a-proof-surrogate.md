Proof surrogates are an important part of verifying and validating proof documents. They are used to verify the authenticity of a document, to prevent fraud and errors, or to protect a document from being altered or tampered with. In this article, we will discuss what a proof surrogate is, the different types of proof surrogates, and which of the following contains a proof surrogate. 

<h2>What is a Proof Surrogate?</h2>

A proof surrogate is an electronic copy of a document that is used to verify the authenticity of the original document. The copy is usually a digital file, such as a PDF, that is stored on a computer or other device. The proof surrogate contains the same information as the original document, including any signatures, seals, or logos. However, the proof surrogate is not the original document and does not have the same legal standing as the original document. 

Proof surrogates are useful for a variety of reasons. They can be used to verify the authenticity of a document or to make sure that a document has not been tampered with. They can also be used to store documents electronically, saving time and money by eliminating the need to print, file, and store paper documents. 

<h2>Different Types of Proof Surrogates</h2>

There are several different types of proof surrogates. These include digital signatures, digital certificates, digital seals, and digital credentials. 

<h3>Digital Signatures</h3>

A digital signature is a type of proof surrogate that is used to verify the authenticity of a document. Digital signatures use public key cryptography to create an electronic “fingerprint” of the document. This fingerprint is then used to verify that the document has not been altered or tampered with. 

<h3>Digital Certificates</h3>

Digital certificates are another type of proof surrogate. Digital certificates contain information about the document and the person who signed it. This information can include the name of the person who signed the document, the date and time the document was signed, and a digital “thumbprint” that is used to verify the document’s authenticity. 

<h3>Digital Seals</h3>

Digital seals are another type of proof surrogate. Digital seals are used to verify the authenticity of a document and to protect it from being tampered with. Digital seals are unique to each document and can be used to verify that the document has not been altered in any way. 

<h3>Digital Credentials</h3>

Digital credentials are another type of proof surrogate. Digital credentials are used to verify the identity of the person who is signing a document. Digital credentials can include a username and password, a biometric scan, or a digital signature. 

<h2>Which of the Following Contains a Proof Surrogate?</h2>

Now that we have discussed the different types of proof surrogates, let’s take a look at which of the following contain a proof surrogate: 

<ul>
    <li>A signed paper document</li>
    <li>A PDF document that has been digitally signed</li>
    <li>An email with a digital signature</li>
    <li>A digital seal embedded in a PDF document</li>
    <li>A digital credential used to sign a document</li>
</ul>

Of the five examples given, only two contain a proof surrogate: a PDF document that has been digitally signed, and a digital seal embedded in a PDF document. 

A signed paper document does not contain a proof surrogate. While the signature on the paper document can be used to verify the authenticity of the document, it does not contain the same electronic “fingerprint” that a digital signature or digital seal would contain. 

An email with a digital signature does contain a proof surrogate. The digital signature on the email can be used to verify the authenticity of the document, as well as to protect it from being tampered with. 

A digital seal embedded in a PDF document does contain a proof surrogate. The digital seal is unique to each document, and can be used to verify that the document has not been altered in any way. 

A digital credential used to sign a document also contains a proof surrogate. The digital credential can be used to verify the identity of the person who is signing the document.
