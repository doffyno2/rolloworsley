What Kind of Brakes Should You Use?


When it comes to choosing the right brakes for your vehicle, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer. The type of brakes you should use depends on the type of vehicle you have, the amount of braking power you need and the kind of driving you do. Whether you’re a first-time car buyer or an experienced mechanic, understanding the different types of brakes on the market can help you make the best decision for your vehicle.

<h2>Types of Brakes</h2>

Disc brakes, drum brakes and parking brakes are the three primary types of brakes used in vehicles today. Disc brakes are the most common and are typically found in cars, SUVs and light trucks. Disc brakes utilize a rotor, a caliper and brake pads to slow down the vehicle when the driver presses the brake pedal. Drum brakes use a wheel cylinder, shoe and drum to slow down the vehicle and are usually found in older cars, while parking brakes are used to keep the vehicle in stationary positions and are usually found in manual transmissions.

<h2>Disc Brakes</h2>

Disc brakes are the most common type of brakes used in vehicles today and offer the highest level of braking performance. They work by pressing brake pads against the rotor, which is attached to the wheel hub and slows down the wheel. Disc brakes are typically found in cars, SUVs and light trucks, and are more powerful and responsive than drum brakes. Some higher-end vehicles may also feature disc brakes on all four wheels.

<h2>Drum Brakes</h2>

Drum brakes are the oldest type of brakes and are typically found in older cars. They work by pressing a wheel cylinder against a drum, which is connected to the wheel hub and slows down the wheel. Drum brakes are less powerful than disc brakes and can be less responsive in emergency braking situations.

<h2>Parking Brakes</h2>

Parking brakes are used to keep the vehicle in stationary positions and are usually found in manual transmission vehicles. They work by pressing a lever against the transmission, which locks the transmission and prevents the vehicle from moving.

<h2>Choosing the Right Brakes</h2>

When choosing the right brakes for your vehicle, it is important to consider the type of vehicle you have, the amount of braking power you need and the kind of driving you do. Disc brakes are typically best for cars, SUVs and light trucks, while drum brakes are better for older vehicles. Parking brakes are best used for manual transmission vehicles.
