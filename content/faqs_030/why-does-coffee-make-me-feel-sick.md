<p>It’s a common occurrence, particularly among those who have just begun drinking coffee. You take a sip of that delicious hot beverage, only to find yourself feeling rather queasy afterwards. If you’ve ever experienced this, you’re likely wondering why coffee makes you feel sick. We’re here to answer that question and provide some helpful tips on how to avoid the unpleasant feeling.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Nausea?</h2>

<p>There are a few possible causes of the nausea associated with coffee consumption. The first is simply the high acidity of the beverage. Many people are sensitive to the acidity of coffee and will experience an upset stomach after drinking it. Additionally, caffeine is a stimulant, and it can cause nausea and restlessness in some people who consume it. Finally, many people, particularly those who are new to coffee, will experience an unpleasant feeling after drinking a large amount of caffeine in a short period of time.</p>

<h2>Tips on Avoiding the Nausea</h2>

<p>If you’re looking to enjoy your cup of joe without feeling queasy, there are some things you can do. First and foremost, consider using a cold brew instead of traditional hot coffee. Cold brew is lower in acidity, meaning it’s less likely to cause an upset stomach. Additionally, try adding milk or cream to your coffee.
