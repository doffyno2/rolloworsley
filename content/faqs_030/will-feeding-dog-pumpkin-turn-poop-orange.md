<h2>Is Orange Poop a Cause for Concern?</h2>

In most cases, orange poop is not a cause for concern. If your dog is eating a balanced diet and gets plenty of exercise, orange poop is likely just a sign that they are getting plenty of beta-carotene. However, if your dog is experiencing other digestive issues, such as diarrhea or vomiting, it is important to consult a veterinarian.

<h2>How Much Pumpkin Should I Feed My Dog?</h2>

When it comes to feeding your dog pumpkin, it is important to consult a veterinarian. The amount of pumpkin that your dog should eat will depend on their age, breed, and overall health.
