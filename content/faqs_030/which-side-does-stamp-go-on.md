<p>When you need to mail a letter, postcard, or package, you might be wondering which side of the envelope the stamp should go on. There’s no standard answer, as the placement of the stamp depends on the type of envelope you are mailing and the country you are mailing it from. Here’s a look at some general guidelines for the placement of a stamp on an envelope.</p>

<h2>Standard Envelope Placement</h2>

<p>Generally, when mailing a standard letter-sized envelope within the United States, you should place the stamp in the upper right-hand corner of the envelope. The stamp should be placed on the envelope so that it is facing the back flap of the envelope. If there are multiple stamps, the uppermost stamp should be placed in the upper right-hand corner, followed by the other stamps placed in the same row. This is the most common and accepted way to mail a letter in the United States.</p>

<h2>International Envelope Placement</h2>

<p>If you are mailing a letter to an international address, you may need to place the stamp in a different spot. The exact location of the stamp varies depending on the country. Some countries require the stamp to be placed in the center of the envelope, while other countries require the stamp to be placed in the upper right-hand corner. To make sure your envelope is properly stamped, you should check the mailing guidelines for the specific country. Additionally, some countries require additional postage for international mail, so you should make sure to include the correct amount of postage.</p>

<h2>Postcard Envelope Placement</h2>

<p>When mailing a postcard, you should place the stamp in the upper right-hand corner of the postcard. This is true for both domestic and international mail. Postcards typically require less postage than a regular letter, so make sure to check the postage requirements for postcards before you mail it.</p>

<h2>Package Envelope Placement</h2>

<p>The placement of the stamp on a package envelope also varies depending on the country. In the United States, you should place the stamp in the upper right-hand corner of the package. However, other countries may require the stamp to be placed in the center of the package or in a different location. Additionally, packages typically require more postage than a regular letter or postcard, so make sure to include the correct amount of postage.</p>

For standard letters mailed within the United States, the stamp should be placed in the upper right-hand corner.
