<p>Having a riding lawn mower is a great way to cut your grass quickly and efficiently. But, when your Craftsman riding lawn mower won't start, it can be a real pain. In this article, we’ll cover the most common causes of why your Craftsman riding lawn mower won’t start, and how to fix them. Read on to discover the answers to your Craftsman riding lawn mower woes.</p>

<h2>Check the Ignition Switch</h2>

<p>The first thing to check when your Craftsman riding lawn mower won't start is the ignition switch. This switch is responsible for supplying power to the mower’s engine. If the switch is damaged or malfunctioning, it can prevent the mower from starting.</p>

<p>To check the ignition switch, start by locating the switch. It’s usually located near the steering wheel or the dashboard of the mower. Once you’ve located it, use a multimeter to test the switch. If the switch is damaged or malfunctioning, it will need to be replaced.</p>

<h2>Check the Battery</h2>

<p>If the ignition switch is in working order, the next step is to check the battery. The battery provides power to the mower’s starter, which is responsible for starting the engine. If the battery is dead or damaged, the mower won’t start.</p>

<p>To check the battery, start by disconnecting the battery cables. Then, use a multimeter to test the battery’s voltage. If the battery is dead, it will need to be replaced. If it’s not dead, use a battery charger to charge the battery.</p>

<h2>Check the Fuel System</h2>

<p>If the battery is in working order, the next step is to check the fuel system. The fuel system is responsible for supplying fuel to the mower’s engine. If the fuel system is blocked or damaged, the mower won’t start.</p>

<p>To check the fuel system, start by checking the fuel filter. If the filter is clogged, it will need to be replaced. Then, check the fuel lines for any signs of damage. If any of the lines are damaged, they will need to be replaced. Finally, check the fuel tank for any signs of rust or damage.</p>

<h2>Check the Spark Plug</h2>

<p>If the fuel system is in working order, the next step is to check the spark plug. The spark plug is responsible for supplying a spark to the mower’s engine. If the spark plug is damaged or malfunctioning, the mower won’t start.</p>

<p>To check the spark plug, start by locating the spark plug. The spark plug is usually located near the mower’s air filter. Once you’ve located it, use a spark plug tester to test the spark plug. If the spark plug is damaged or malfunctioning, it will need to be replaced.</p>

<h2>Check the Carburetor</h2>

<p>If the spark plug is in working order, the next step is to check the carburetor. The carburetor is responsible for mixing fuel and air in the mower’s engine. If the carburetor is blocked or damaged, the mower won’t start.</p>

<p>To check the carburetor, start by removing the air filter. Then, locate the carburetor and use a carburetor cleaner to clean it. If the carburetor is damaged, it will need to be replaced.</p>
