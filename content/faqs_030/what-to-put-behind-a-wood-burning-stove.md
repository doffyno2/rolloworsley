Wood burning stoves are becoming increasingly popular as a cost-effective and efficient way to heat your home. But before you can use your wood burning stove, you need to make sure that you have the right materials and safety measures in place to ensure that your home remains safe and your stove is working as efficiently as possible. 

The most important thing to consider when installing a wood burning stove is the material you will use to line the wall behind it. This material, known as a ‘hearth’ or ‘heat shield’, is an essential component of your wood burning stove installation, as it serves both to protect your home from the intense heat of the fire and to provide a safe and efficient burning surface. 

<h2>What Materials Can Be Used To Line The Wall Behind A Wood Burning Stove? </h2>

There are several materials that can be used to line the wall behind a wood burning stove. These materials vary in cost, installation difficulty, and fireproofing capabilities. 

The most common material used to line the wall behind a wood burning stove is brick or stone. Brick and stone are both highly fireproof, and they can provide a beautiful and traditional look to your home. However, installing brick or stone can be a difficult and expensive endeavor, as it requires a great deal of labor and expertise. 

Another material that can be used to line the wall behind a wood burning stove is drywall. Drywall is much easier to install than brick or stone, and it is highly fireproof. However, drywall does not provide the same level of protection as brick or stone, and it does not have the same look or feel. 

Finally, there are specialized heat shields designed specifically for use with wood burning stoves. These heat shields are made of fireproof materials such as ceramic fiber or metal and provide excellent protection from the intense heat of the fire. They are generally easier to install than brick or stone, and they can provide a more modern look to your home. 

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of Using A Hearth Or Heat Shield? </h2>

Using a hearth or heat shield is essential for safely and properly installing a wood burning stove. Hearth materials provide several important benefits, including: 

1. Improved safety. Hearth materials provide a fireproof barrier between your home and the fire, which can help prevent structural damage to your home in the event of a fire.

2. Increased efficiency. Hearth materials help to keep heat from escaping into the walls behind the stove, which helps to improve the efficiency of the stove. 

3. Easier cleaning. Hearth materials can help to keep soot from accumulating on the walls behind the stove, making it easier to clean and maintain the stove. 

<h2>How Should A Hearth Or Heat Shield Be Installed? </h2>

Proper installation of a hearth or heat shield is essential for ensuring the safety and efficiency of your wood burning stove. When installing a hearth or heat shield, you should: 

1. Measure the area behind the stove. Be sure to measure both the width and the height of the area and make sure you have enough material to fully cover the wall. 

2. Prepare the wall. Remove any existing materials such as wallpaper or paneling and make sure the wall is smooth and even. 

3. Install the hearth material. Depending on the type of material you are using, this may involve attaching it directly to the wall with screws or nails, or it may involve attaching it to metal brackets that are then secured to the wall. 

4. Seal the seams. If you are using multiple pieces of hearth material, be sure to seal the seams between them with silicone caulk or fireproof tape. 

5. Check for gaps. Once the hearth material is installed, check for any gaps between the hearth material and the walls. If any gaps are present, seal them with silicone caulk or fireproof tape. 

<h2>What Other Safety Measures Should Be Taken When Installing A Wood Burning Stove? </h2>

In addition to installing a hearth or heat shield, there are several other safety measures you should take when installing a wood burning stove. These measures include: 

1. Installing a chimney liner. A chimney liner ensures that smoke and other combustion byproducts are properly vented from your home. 

2. Installing a carbon monoxide detector. Carbon monoxide is an odorless and colorless gas that can be deadly, so it's important to install a carbon monoxide detector near your wood burning stove. 

3. Installing a fire extinguisher. Keeping a fire extinguisher near your wood burning stove can help prevent small fires from becoming larger. 

4. Storing wood properly. Make sure that you store wood in a dry, well-ventilated area away from the stove.
