<p>Schwinn is a legendary brand of bicycles that has been around for over a century. Since 1895, Schwinn has been producing bicycles for adults, children, and even mountain bikes for the adventurous. The company has come a long way since then, and now its products are found in stores all over the world. But when did Schwinn finally sell out?</p>

<p>The answer depends on who you ask. To some, Schwinn sold out in the early 2000s when it was bought out by a company called Pacific Cycle. Pacific Cycle was owned by a larger company called Dorel Industries, and they took control of Schwinn's operations in 2001. This was the first time that Schwinn had been owned by an outside company, and it signaled a change in the way that the brand was operated. </p>

<p>Under the new ownership, Schwinn began to focus more on mass-market products and less on the quality that the company was known for. This shift in strategy saw Schwinn abandoning some of its iconic designs and focusing on cheaper, more affordable bike models. This change was not popular with Schwinn fans, and many saw it as a betrayal of the brand's legacy.</p>

<p>However, there are others who argue that Schwinn did not truly sell out until much later. After Dorel Industries took control of Schwinn in 2001, the company continued to operate as a standalone brand until 2009. During this time, Schwinn still released new bike models that were designed with the same level of quality that the company was known for. This was the era when Schwinn released some of its most iconic bikes, including the Sting-Ray and the Cruiser. </p>

<p>It was not until 2009 that Schwinn was fully integrated into Dorel Industries. This meant that Schwinn stopped operating as an independent brand and was now part of a larger corporate entity. This integration saw a further shift away from the quality products that Schwinn was known for and towards cheaper, lower quality products.</p>

<p>So, while the exact time that Schwinn sold out is open to debate, it is clear that the company changed drastically under new ownership. The introduction of cheaper bikes and the full integration of Schwinn into a larger corporate entity marked a clear shift in the company's approach to its products. </p>

<h2>Why Did Schwinn Sell Out?</h2>

<p>Schwinn's decision to sell out to Dorel Industries was motivated by a number of factors. The most important of these was the fact that Schwinn was facing serious financial difficulties at the time. The company had been struggling for years and was unable to compete with the larger, more established bike manufacturers. </p>

<p>The sale to Dorel Industries provided Schwinn with the capital it needed to stay afloat and allowed the company to continue producing bikes. However, the sale came at the cost of Schwinn's independence, as the company was now a part of a larger corporate entity. This meant that Schwinn was no longer able to make decisions independently and was now subject to the decisions of Dorel Industries.</p>

<p>The sale also allowed Schwinn to access new markets and expand its product range. Under Dorel Industries, Schwinn was able to produce cheaper bikes that allowed it to compete in the mass-market. This allowed the company to sell more bikes and reach a wider audience. </p>

<p>Finally, the sale gave Schwinn access to Dorel Industries' wider distribution network. This allowed Schwinn to expand its reach and sell its products in more stores around the world. </p>

<h2>What Happened After Schwinn Sold Out?</h2>

<p>After Schwinn sold out to Dorel Industries, the company saw a drastic shift in its operations. The company began to focus more on mass-market bikes, which were cheaper and of lower quality than Schwinn's traditional models. This shift in strategy alienated many of Schwinn's loyal fans and caused the company to lose much of its reputation for quality.</p>

<p>However, the sale to Dorel Industries also allowed Schwinn to expand its product range and reach new markets. The company was now able to produce cheaper bikes that allowed it to compete in the mass-market and this allowed it to reach a wider audience. Schwinn also began to produce electric bikes, which were more popular at the time. </p>

<p>Today, Schwinn is still a part of Dorel Industries and continues to produce a wide range of bikes for all types of riders. The company is still known for its quality products and has a loyal following of fans. However, the company's focus on mass-market bikes has caused it to lose some of its reputation for quality and its iconic designs are no longer as popular as they once were. </p>
