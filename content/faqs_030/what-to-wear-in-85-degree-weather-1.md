<p>When the temperatures start to rise, it can be difficult to decide what to wear in 85 degree weather. With the summer months in full swing, it's important to stay cool and comfortable while looking stylish. Whether you’re headed to the beach, the office, or out for a night on the town, here are some tips on what to wear in 85 degree weather.</p>

<h2>Lightweight Clothing</h2>

<p>One of the most important things to keep in mind when dressing for the hot weather is to wear lightweight fabrics. Lightweight materials, such as cotton and linen, are great for keeping cool and looking stylish. Choose clothing items with a loose fit so air can circulate around your body and keep you cool. Avoid wearing anything too tight, as this can cause you to overheat and become uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>Choose Breathable Fabrics</h2>

<p>When picking out what to wear in 85 degree weather, it’s important to choose breathable fabrics that will keep the air circulating. Look for fabrics such as cotton, linen, or silk, which are all lightweight and will allow air to pass through. Avoid fabrics like polyester or nylon, which can trap heat and cause you to overheat.</p>

<h2>Avoid Dark Colours</h2>

<p>Dark colours absorb more heat than lighter tones, so when choosing what to wear in 85 degree weather, it’s best to opt for lighter shades. White, beige, and pastels are all great options as they won’t absorb as much heat, keeping you cooler during the hot summer months.</p>

<h2>Try Floral Prints</h2>

<p>Floral prints are a great way to add a bit of colour to your summer wardrobe. Choose lightweight fabrics in bright colours and patterns for a fun and stylish look. Floral prints can be worn for a variety of occasions, from the beach to the office and everything in between.</p>

<h2>Choose Appropriate Footwear</h2>

<p>When deciding what to wear in 85 degree weather, don’t forget about your feet. Sandals are a great option for the hot summer months. Choose sandals with breathable materials such as leather or canvas so your feet won’t overheat. Flip-flops are also a great option for a casual day outfit, but avoid wearing them for more formal occasions.</p>

<h2>Layer Your Outfits</h2>

<p>Layering is key when it comes to staying cool in the hot weather. Choose lightweight fabrics such as linen or cotton, and layer your clothing items in order to keep cool. Start with a light tank top or camisole and layer on a lightweight dress or skirt. You can also add a light cardigan or jacket for when the weather gets a bit cooler in the evening.</p>

<h2>Accessorize with a Hat</h2>

<p>Accessorizing with a hat is a great way to add a bit of style to your outfit while keeping your head cool. Choose a wide-brimmed hat to keep the sun off your face and neck, or opt for a baseball cap for a more casual look. A straw hat is also a great option for a beach outing.</p>
