Mountains come in all shapes and sizes, and they can be found in all corners of the world. From the towering Himalayas in Asia to the Rockies in North America, mountains are an integral part of the landscape. But what is the highest mountain in the lower 48 states?

The highest mountain in the lower 48 states is Mount Whitney in California. At 14,505 feet (4,421 meters) above sea level, it is the highest peak in the contiguous United States. It is part of the Sierra Nevada mountain range, which stretches along the western states from California to New Mexico.

<h2>The History of Mount Whitney</h2>

Mount Whitney was named after the surveyor and explorer Josiah Whitney, who was the first to measure its elevation. Since then, it has become a popular destination for hikers, climbers, and sightseers. It was first summited by three men in 1873, and since then the peak has been visited by thousands of people. 

The mountain is part of the John Muir Trail, a 211-mile (340-kilometer) hiking trail that runs from Yosemite Valley to the peak of Mount Whitney. It is a popular route for experienced hikers looking for a challenge, and the trail passes through some of the most beautiful and rugged terrain in the country.

The trail is strenuous and requires a good level of physical fitness. It is also important to be properly prepared for the conditions and the elevation. Hikers should bring plenty of food, water, and the right clothing and equipment.
