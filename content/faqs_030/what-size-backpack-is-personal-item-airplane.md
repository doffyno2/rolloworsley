Traveling by airplane can be a stressful experience, especially when it comes to packing. One of the most difficult decisions travelers have to make is what size backpack they can take on the plane as a personal item. With airlines having different regulations and restrictions on size and weight, it can be hard to know what size backpack is allowed.
