<p>Mormon missionaries have been seen riding bikes around the world for over a century. It's a tradition that dates back to the beginnings of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS), and it's one of the most visible aspects of the Mormon faith. But why do Mormon missionaries ride bikes?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: it's a cost-effective way of getting around. The Church encourages its missionaries to use bikes as their primary means of transportation, as it's a much cheaper option than renting cars or taking public transportation. Bikes also allow missionaries to cover large areas quickly and easily, allowing them to reach more people in a shorter amount of time.</p>

<p>The Church also wants its missionaries to stay active and healthy, and riding a bike for hours every day is a great way to do that. It's also more eco-friendly than other forms of transportation, which is important for a church that values environmental stewardship. Plus, the Church believes that missionaries should live simply, and biking is a perfect way to do that.</p>

<p>But there's more to it than practicality and cost savings. Biking has become an iconic symbol of the Mormon faith. It reminds people of the missionaries who have gone out into the world to share their faith with others. It also serves as a reminder that the Church is an international organization with missionaries in many different countries.</p>

<p>For many Mormons, biking is an important part of their faith—a sign of dedication and commitment to their beliefs. It's also a great way to meet people and share stories, as well as a way to stay active and healthy. So when you see Mormon missionaries riding bikes, it's more than just a practical way of getting around—it's a sign of faith and service.</p>

<h2>The History of Mormon Biking</h2>

<p>The tradition of Mormon biking goes back to the earliest days of the Church. In the mid-1800s, Brigham Young, the second president of the LDS Church, encouraged members to take up biking as a form of exercise and transportation. In fact, many of his converts brought their bikes with them when they emigrated to Utah.</p>

<p>The Church also began to send out its own missionaries on bicycles in the late 19th century. These missionaries were often sent to remote areas in Utah and Idaho, where the Church was still establishing its presence. The Church also sent out groups of missionaries on bikes to other parts of the world, including Europe, the Pacific Islands, and South America.</p>

<p>Today, biking is still popular among Mormon missionaries. The Church encourages its missionaries to use bikes as their primary means of transportation, as it's a much cheaper option than renting cars or taking public transportation. Bikes also allow missionaries to cover large areas quickly and easily, allowing them to reach more people in a shorter amount of time.</p>
