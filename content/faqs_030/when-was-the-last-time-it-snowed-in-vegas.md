<p>Vegas, or Las Vegas as it is officially known, is one of the world’s most iconic cities. It is famous for its bright lights, casinos and entertainment. With its year-round warm temperatures, it may come as a surprise to some that it can snow in Vegas. But the truth is, it has happened before and it could happen again.</p>

<p>Vegas has a semi-arid climate, with hot summers and mild winters. The average annual temperature is around 18°C (64°F). The city’s location in the Mojave Desert means that it rarely experiences snowfall, with only a few inches falling in the city each year. On average, it snows in Las Vegas about once every 10 years.</p>

<p>The last time it snowed in Vegas was on December 17th, 2008. The snowfall was light, with only a few inches of wet snow accumulating in some areas. It was the first time in 28 years that the city had seen a measurable amount of snow. The previous snowfall had been on January 14th, 1980, when a total of 3 inches of snow was recorded.</p>

<p>The 2008 snowfall was unexpected, as it arrived during a period of unusually warm weather. The temperature dropped quickly after the snow began to fall, reaching a low of 27°F (-3°C). The snow melted quickly due to the warm air temperature and bright sunshine, and the roads were soon cleared.</p>

<h2>How Often Does It Snow in Vegas?</h2> 

<p>As mentioned above, it snows in Vegas about once every 10 years on average. This is due to the fact that it is located in the Mojave Desert, which is one of the driest places on earth. The city is also located in a rain shadow, meaning that most of the moisture in the air is blocked by the nearby mountains.</p>

<p>However, the city does experience occasional snowfall. This is usually caused by a weather phenomenon known as the “Las Vegas snow bomb”. This is when a low-pressure system moves in from the Pacific Ocean and interacts with cold air from the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The result is a sudden and intense snowfall, which can last for several hours.</p>

<h2>What Are the Chances of Seeing Snow in Vegas?</h2>

<p>The chances of seeing snow in Vegas are relatively low. As mentioned before, only a few inches of snowfall accumulate in the city each year. This is due to the city’s location in the Mojave Desert and its lack of moisture. The chances of seeing a “snow bomb” are even lower, as these occur very rarely.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to experience a “white Christmas” in Las Vegas. The city has seen snowfall on Christmas Day on several occasions, including in 2008 and 2005. But this is rare, and the chances of seeing snow in Vegas on Christmas are very slim.</p>

<h2>What Is the Best Time of Year to Visit Vegas If You Want to See Snow?</h2>
