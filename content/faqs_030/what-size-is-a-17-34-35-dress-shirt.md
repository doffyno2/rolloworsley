<p>When it comes to dress shirts, size is everything. Getting the right fit can make or break your outfit. But what size is a 17 34 35 dress shirt? What does this number mean and how can you find the perfect shirt for your body type? In this article, we’ll explore the basics of dress shirt sizing and help you find the perfect fit.</p>

<h2>Understanding Dress Shirt Sizing</h2>

<p>Dress shirt sizes are based on two measurements: the neck size and the sleeve length. The neck size is the circumference of your neck, and the sleeve length is the measurement from the shoulder to the wrist. In most cases, dress shirts are labeled with two numbers separated by a slash. In the case of a 17 34 35 shirt, the first number is the neck size, 17”, and the second number is the sleeve length, 34”-35”. </p>

<p>When shopping for dress shirts, it’s important to understand your body type and find the right fit. People with larger shoulders and long arms may need to buy larger dress shirts with longer sleeve lengths. On the other hand, people with shorter arms and narrow shoulders may find that standard dress shirt sizes are too large. </p>

<h2>How to Measure for Dress Shirts</h2>

<p>The best way to get the perfect fit for a dress shirt is to take your own measurements. To measure your neck size, use a cloth tape measure and wrap it around your neck. Make sure the tape measure is snug but not too tight. Write down the measurement and use it to find the right neck size for your shirt. </p>

<p>To measure your sleeve length, start by measuring from the center back of your neck to the shoulder. Then measure from the shoulder to the wrist. Add these two measurements together to get your sleeve length. Again, make sure the tape measure is snug but not too tight. </p>

<h2>Finding the Right Fit</h2>

<p>Once you’ve taken your measurements, it’s time to find the right dress shirt. Start by looking for shirts that have a neck size close to your own. Most dress shirts come in sizes ranging from 14” to 18”, so you should be able to find a shirt that fits. </p>

<p>Next, look for a shirt with a sleeve length that is close to your own measurement. Most dress shirts come in sleeve lengths ranging from 32” to 36”. If your sleeve length is outside this range, you may need to look for a custom dress shirt. </p>

<p>Finally, make sure the shirt fits your body type. Some dress shirts are tailored for a slim fit, while others are designed for a more relaxed fit. Choose a shirt that flatters your body type and fits comfortably.</p>
