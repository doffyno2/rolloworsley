<p>Finding the right bike size is an important part of choosing the right bike. Selecting a bike size that is too big or too small can lead to an uncomfortable, inefficient, and unsafe ride. By understanding how bike sizing works, you can make sure you get a bike that fits your body and riding style. </p>

<p>Bike sizing is based on the frame size, which is measured from the center of the bottom bracket to the top of the seat tube. The frame size is usually expressed as a number, typically ranging from 44 cm to 62 cm. Frame size is just one part of the equation. You also need to consider the rider’s height, inseam length, and arm length. </p>

<p>A 56 cm frame size is considered a medium-sized frame. It is suitable for riders between 5'6" and 5'10". The inseam length should be between 29" and 32", and the arm length should be between 21" and 24". </p>
