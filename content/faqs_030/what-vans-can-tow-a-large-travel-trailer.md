What Vans Can Tow a Large Travel Trailer?
The ability to tow a large travel trailer is an important feature to consider when shopping for a van. Many smaller vans cannot tow a large travel trailer, but there are some larger models that can. To determine what vans can tow a large travel trailer, it is important to understand the towing capacity of the vehicle and the size of the trailer.


Towing capacity is the maximum weight of a vehicle that is able to be towed safely. The towing capacity of a vehicle is determined by its engine size, transmission, and other vehicle components. For example, a larger engine will be able to tow a heavier trailer than a smaller engine. It is important to check the manufacturer's specifications for the towing capacity of a vehicle before purchasing it.


The size of a large travel trailer will vary depending on the type and model of trailer. Generally, a large travel trailer is defined as a trailer that is over 20 feet in length. This size trailer can weigh between 5,000 and 10,000 pounds. It is important to check the size and weight of the trailer before attempting to tow it with a van.
