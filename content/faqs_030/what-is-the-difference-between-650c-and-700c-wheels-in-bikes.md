Bicycles come in different shapes and sizes, and the type of wheels used can influence the characteristics of the bike. Two of the most common sizes of wheels are 650c and 700c. While they look similar, there are some important differences between them. In this article, we will look at the differences between 650c and 700c wheels in bikes.

<h2>What Is 650c?</h2>

650c is a size of wheel used in bicycles. It is one of the most common sizes of wheels for road bikes and is also used in some mountain bikes. 650c wheels are generally used on bikes designed for smaller riders, such as those under 5’6” tall. 650c wheels are also sometimes used on triathlon and time trial bikes, as the smaller wheels can provide an aerodynamic advantage in certain conditions.

<h2>What Is 700c?</h2>

700c is another size of wheel used in bicycles. It is the most common size of wheel for road bikes and is also used in some mountain bikes. 700c wheels are generally used on bikes designed for taller riders, such as those over 5’6” tall. 700c wheels are also sometimes used on triathlon and time trial bikes, as the larger wheels can provide an aerodynamic advantage in certain conditions.

<h2>What Are The Differences Between 650c And 700c Wheels?</h2>

The main difference between 650c and 700c wheels is their size. 650c wheels are smaller than 700c wheels, and they are designed for smaller riders. 650c wheels have a diameter of 584mm (23”), while 700c wheels have a diameter of 622mm (24.5”).

In addition to the difference in size, there are also differences in the type of tires used on each size of wheel. 650c wheels typically use narrower tires, as the smaller wheel size does not provide enough space for wider tires. 700c wheels typically use wider tires, as the larger wheel size provides enough space for wider tires. 

The weight of the wheels is also different between the two sizes. 650c wheels tend to be lighter than 700c wheels, as the smaller size requires less material to construct. This can give 650c wheels an advantage when it comes to acceleration and speed. 

<h2>What Are The Pros And Cons Of 650c And 700c Wheels?</h2>

The main advantage of 650c wheels is that they are lighter than 700c wheels, which can provide an advantage when it comes to acceleration and speed. 650c wheels also use narrower tires, which can provide an aerodynamic advantage in certain conditions. 

The main disadvantage of 650c wheels is that they are designed for smaller riders, which can be an issue for taller riders. In addition, the narrower tires used on 650c wheels can provide less traction in certain conditions, such as muddy roads. 

The main advantage of 700c wheels is that they are designed for taller riders, which can be an issue for smaller riders. In addition, the wider tires used on 700c wheels can provide more traction in certain conditions, such as on wet roads. 

The main disadvantage of 700c wheels is that they are heavier than 650c wheels, which can provide a disadvantage when it comes to acceleration and speed. In addition, the wider tires used on 700c wheels can provide an aerodynamic disadvantage in certain conditions.
