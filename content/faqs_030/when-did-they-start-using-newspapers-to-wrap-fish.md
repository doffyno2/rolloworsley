<h2>The Origins of Wrapping Fish in Newspaper</h2>

<p>The practice of wrapping fish in newspaper is believed to have originated in the UK in the late 19th century. It is thought to have started as a way to keep fish fresh and protect it from becoming contaminated by other food items. At the time, newspapers were relatively inexpensive and readily available, making them an ideal material for food wrapping. While the exact origins of the practice are unknown, it is likely that it was developed by the British fishermen who wanted to keep their catch fresh and safe to eat.</p>

<p>The popularity of wrapping fish in newspaper quickly spread throughout the UK, and eventually became a common practice in many other parts of the world. By the early 20th century, it was a common sight in fish markets and restaurants. In the US, the practice became so widespread that it was actually mentioned in the 1939 edition of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>.</p>

<h2>Why Is Newspaper Still Used to Wrap Fish?</h2>

Another advantage of wrapping fish in newspaper is that it is also biodegradable, making it a much more environmentally friendly option than plastic wrapping.</p>

<p>In addition to its practical advantages, wrapping fish in newspaper also has a certain nostalgic charm. The sight of a fish wrapped in newspaper is often associated with traditional fish markets and seafood restaurants, and it can evoke a feeling of nostalgia or a connection to the past.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Downsides to Wrapping Fish in Newspaper? </h2>
