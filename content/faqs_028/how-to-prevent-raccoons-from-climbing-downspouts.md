<p>Raccoons are intelligent and resourceful creatures. They are also notorious for getting into places they shouldn't be, including downspouts. Unfortunately, these furry animals can cause a lot of damage if they are able to make their way into your home or business. Fortunately, there are several strategies you can use to keep them out of your downspouts.</p>

<h2>1. Install Covers on Your Downspouts</h2>

<p>One of the best ways to keep raccoons out of your downspouts is to install covers. These covers are available at most hardware stores, and they fit over the opening of the downspout. The covers are designed with small holes that allow water to pass through, but not animals. When the covers are installed correctly, they should be enough to keep raccoons from being able to climb into the downspouts.</p>

<h2>2. Make Your Downspouts Unappealing to Raccoons</h2>

<p>Another way to prevent raccoons from climbing downspouts is to make them unappealing to the animals. Raccoons are naturally curious creatures and are drawn to places that offer shelter and food. To make your downspouts unappealing to raccoons, you can spray them with a mixture of water and vinegar. You can also try sprinkling a mixture of strong-smelling herbs, such as peppermint, around the downspouts. These smells can be unappealing to raccoons and may help keep them away.</p>

<h2>3. Install Motion-Activated Sprinklers</h2>

<p>Motion-activated sprinklers are a great way to keep raccoons away from your downspouts. These devices detect movement and spray a blast of water in that direction. Whenever a raccoon approaches the downspout, the sprinkler will activate and scare them away. Most motion-activated sprinklers are easy to install and require no extra wiring.</p>

<h2>4. Install Mesh or Hardware Cloth</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a more permanent solution to keep raccoons out of your downspouts, consider installing mesh or hardware cloth. These materials are available at most hardware stores, and they can be easily cut to fit your downspouts. The mesh or hardware cloth should be installed so that it covers the entire length of the downspout, from the bottom to the top. This will make it impossible for raccoons to climb into the downspout.</p>

<h2>5. Trim Back Trees and Bushes</h2>

<p>Raccoons often use trees and bushes to climb onto roofs and into downspouts. To prevent this from happening, you should trim back any trees or bushes that are close to your home. This will make it more difficult for raccoons to reach your home and make it easier for you to spot them if they do try to climb up.</p>
