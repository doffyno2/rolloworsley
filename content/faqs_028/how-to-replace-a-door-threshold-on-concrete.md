<p>Replacing a door threshold is a great way to keep your home looking neat and tidy. It can also help save energy by preventing drafts from entering your home. Thresholds provide a seal around the exterior of a door and are essential for keeping water, dirt and pests out.</p>

<p>If you have a concrete threshold, you may be wondering how to replace it. Replacing a concrete door threshold is a relatively straightforward process, but it does require some preparation and knowledge. This article will provide a step-by-step guide for replacing your concrete door threshold.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Area</h2>

<p>Before you start working on replacing the threshold, you need to make sure the area is properly prepared. First, you need to remove any existing threshold. This can be done by prying it off with a flat pry bar. Make sure to wear safety glasses and gloves to protect yourself from any splinters or loose nails.</p>

<p>Once the old threshold has been removed, you need to clean the area. Use a wire brush to remove any dirt or debris. If there is any paint or other residue, you may need to use a chemical stripper to remove it.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Measure the Area</h2>

<p>Once the area has been cleared, you need to measure it. Measure the width of the door frame and the depth of the space between the door frame and the floor. This will help you determine the size of the new threshold.</p>

<p>If the door is in a corner, you will also need to measure the angle of the corner. This will determine how the threshold will need to be cut. If the door is not in a corner, you may need to use a level to ensure that the threshold is level.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Purchase the New Threshold</h2>

<p>Once you have taken all the necessary measurements, you can purchase a new threshold. Make sure to get one that is the same size as the one you removed. If the door is in a corner, you will need to purchase a threshold that is specifically designed for corners.</p>

<p>You should also make sure to purchase one that is made of the same material as the one you removed. This will help ensure that the new threshold will fit properly and last a long time.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Cut the New Threshold</h2>

<p>Once you have the new threshold, you need to cut it to size. This can be done with a jigsaw or circular saw. If the door is in a corner, you will need to make sure that the angle of the cut is accurate.</p>

<p>If you are unsure how to cut the threshold, you may want to consult a professional. A professional can help ensure that the new threshold is cut properly and fits perfectly.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Install the New Threshold</h2>

<p>Once the threshold has been cut, it is time to install it. If you have purchased an adhesive threshold, you will need to apply the adhesive to the threshold and then press it into place. Make sure to press it firmly so that it is firmly attached.</p>

<p>If you have purchased a non-adhesive threshold, you will need to use a hammer and nails to attach it. Make sure to pre-drill the holes before hammering in the nails. This will help ensure that the threshold is securely attached.</p>
