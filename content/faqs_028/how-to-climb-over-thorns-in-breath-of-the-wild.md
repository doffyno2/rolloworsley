Thorns are a type of obstacle that can be found in various locations and they can make it difficult to progress. This article will provide information on how to effectively climb over thorns in Breath of the Wild.</p>

<h2>What are Thorns?</h2>

<p>Thorns are obstacles found in various locations in Breath of the Wild. They are typically found in areas where there is dense vegetation and are usually located in areas where there is no clear path for players to follow. Thorns can be identified by their red-orange hue and spiny appearance. They often block the path of the player and must be climbed over in order to progress. Thorns can be a nuisance and require some effort to overcome, but they can be climbed over by using the right techniques.</p>

<h2>How to Climb Over Thorns?</h2>

<p>Climbing over thorns can be a difficult task, but it can be done with the right techniques. The first step is to identify the thorns and make sure that they are not too high. If they are too high, then they cannot be climbed over without the help of a ladder or other climbing tool. If the thorns are not too high, then the next step is to equip the right clothing and items to make the climb easier. The best clothing to wear is the Champion's Tunic, which provides extra protection against thorns.
