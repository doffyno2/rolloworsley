<p>Making a pool noodle dog collar is a great way to provide your pup with a comfortable and stylish collar for a fraction of what a store-bought one would cost. Pool noodles are inexpensive and easy to find, and you can make a collar in minutes with just a few simple materials. In this article, weâ€™ll show you how to make a pool noodle dog collar that your pup will love.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>To make a pool noodle dog collar, you'll need the following materials:</p>

<ul>
<li>1 pool noodle</li>
<li>1 piece of ribbon</li>
<li>2 pieces of thin rope</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Hot glue gun and glue sticks</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Cut the Pool Noodle in Half</h2>

<p>Take your pool noodle and cut it in half lengthwise with a pair of scissors. This will give you two half-moon shaped pieces of foam that you can use to make two collars.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Cut the Ribbon</h2>

<p>Next, take the ribbon and cut it into two pieces, each about 18 inches long. These pieces of ribbon will be the collars for your pup.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Attach the Ribbon to the Pool Noodle</h2>

<p>Take one of the half-moon shaped pieces of foam and wrap the ribbon around it, making sure that the ribbon is secure. Use the hot glue gun to glue the ribbon in place.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Attach the Rope</h2>

<p>Take the two pieces of rope and tie them onto the opposite ends of the pool noodle. Make sure to tie them securely so that they won't come undone.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Put it on Your Pup</h2>

<p>Now that you have made your pool noodle dog collar, it's time to put it on your pup. Put the collar around your pup's neck and adjust the rope so that the collar fits snugly but isn't too tight. Your pup is now ready to show off his new collar!</p>
