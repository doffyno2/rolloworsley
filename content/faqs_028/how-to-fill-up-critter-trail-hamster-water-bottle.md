<p>Critter Trail hamsters are small, cute, and easy to care for, but it is important to make sure their water bottle is filled up correctly. A full water bottle is essential to keep your Critter Trail hamster healthy and hydrated. Filling up a Critter Trail hamster water bottle is easy and can be done in a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Gather the Supplies</h2>

<p>The first step in filling up a Critter Trail hamster water bottle is to gather the supplies. You'll need a water bottle, a clean water source, and a bottle brush. A bottle brush is a small tool used to clean the inside of the water bottle. It is important to use a clean water source, as dirty water can contain bacteria, which can be harmful to your hamster. Make sure to use clean, filtered water to fill up the bottle.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Clean the Water Bottle</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered all the supplies, it is time to clean the water bottle. Start by removing the plastic cap from the top of the bottle. Use the bottle brush to scrub the inside of the bottle. Make sure to scrub the entire inside of the bottle, including the spout, in order to get rid of any dirt or debris. After scrubbing, rinse the bottle with clean water and let it air dry.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Fill the Water Bottle</h2>

<p>Once the water bottle is clean, you can start filling it up. Place the bottle under a clean water source and slowly fill it up. Be careful not to overfill the bottle, as this can cause it to leak. Once the bottle is full, replace the plastic cap and secure it tightly.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Attach the Water Bottle to the Cage</h2>

<p>The final step is to attach the water bottle to the Critter Trail cage. Most Critter Trail cages come with a holder that attaches to the side of the cage. Place the water bottle in the holder and make sure it is secure. If the holder does not fit securely, you may need to adjust it or use a different holder.</p>
