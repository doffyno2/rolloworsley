How to Make a Digging Box for Dogs


Dogs love to dig and play in the dirt, but sometimes it can be a bit of a problem for owners. It can be difficult to find a place for them to dig that’s safe from harm and that won’t damage the garden or landscaping. Fortunately, there is an easy and affordable solution: build a digging box for dogs.

A digging box for dogs is a great way to give your canine a place to dig and play without risking damage to the yard. It's also a great way to keep your pup from digging up your garden or landscaping.

<h2>What You Need to Make a Digging Box</h2>

Making a digging box for dogs is relatively easy and doesn’t require a lot of materials. Here is a list of everything you will need:

<ul>
<li>Plywood</li>
<li>Heavy-duty plastic tarp</li>
<li>Landscape fabric</li>
<li>Pebbles</li>
<li>Sand</li>
<li>Shovel</li>
<li>Measuring tape</li>
<li>Drill</li>
<li>Screws</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step by Step Guide to Making a Digging Box for Dogs</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Measure and Cut the Plywood</h3>

The first step in making your dog’s digging box is to measure and cut the plywood. You will need to measure and cut four pieces of plywood to make a square box. The size of the box will depend on the size of your yard and the size of your dog. Once you have your measurements, you can use a saw to cut the pieces of plywood. 

<h3>Step 2: Drill Holes in the Plywood</h3>

After you have cut the pieces of plywood, you will need to drill holes in the sides of the box. This will help to ensure that the box is well ventilated. Make sure to use a drill bit that is the same size as the screws you are using.

<h3>Step 3: Attach the Plywood Pieces Together</h3>

Once you have drilled the holes, you can attach the pieces of plywood together using screws. Make sure that the pieces are securely attached and that there are no gaps in the corners.

<h3>Step 4: Cover the Bottom of the Box with Landscape Fabric</h3>

Once the box is assembled, you will need to cover the bottom of the box with landscape fabric. This will help to keep the sand and pebbles from spilling out of the box. Secure the fabric with staples or screws.

<h3>Step 5: Add Sand and Pebbles to the Digging Box</h3>

Next, you will need to add the sand and pebbles to the digging box. This will give your dog something to dig in that is soft and that won’t hurt their paws. Make sure to spread the sand and pebbles evenly in the box so that it’s not too deep in any one area.

<h3>Step 6: Cover the Digging Box with a Heavy-Duty Plastic Tarp</h3>

The last step is to cover the digging box with a heavy-duty plastic tarp. This will help to keep the sand and pebbles from spilling out of the box and will also protect the box from the elements. Secure the tarp to the box with staples or screws.
