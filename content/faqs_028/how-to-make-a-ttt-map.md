<p>Before you start building your TTT map, you need to gather all the necessary resources. This includes textures, models, and tools. Most of these can be found on the Garry’s Mod website. Additionally, some custom textures and models may need to be purchased from external sources. Once you have gathered all the necessary resources, you are ready to start building your map.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Design the Layout</h2>

This will determine how many players can play on the map, and will also affect the types of game modes that can be played. Next, decide on the types of buildings and structures that will be included in the map. For example, if you want to create a map with multiple levels, you will need to build stairs, ladders, and other types of vertical passages. Finally, design the layout of the map. This includes deciding on the placement of spawn points, objectives, and other important locations.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Add Props and Textures</h2>

Additionally, you should play several rounds of TTT on your map to make sure everything is working properly.</p>
