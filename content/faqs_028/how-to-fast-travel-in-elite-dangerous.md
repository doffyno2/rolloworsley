<h2>How To Access Fast Travel In Elite Dangerous</h2>

<p>In order to access fast travel in Elite Dangerous, you must first locate a Jump Point. Jump Points can be found in different areas of the galaxy, but they are typically located in close proximity to star systems. To locate a Jump Point, use your ship's navigation system and look for a star system that has a Jump Point icon next to it. Once you have located a Jump Point, you can access it by flying your ship to it and then selecting the "Jump" option from your ship's control panel.</p>
