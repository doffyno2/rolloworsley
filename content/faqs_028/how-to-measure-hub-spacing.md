<p>When you are building a wheel or replacing a hub, understanding hub spacing is critical to ensure a safe and secure fit. In this article, we will explain what hub spacing is, why it is important and how to measure it. We will also discuss the various types of hub spacing, so you can make an informed decision when selecting a hub or wheel.</p>

<h2>What is Hub Spacing?</h2>

<p>Hub spacing is the distance between the two flanges of the hub. It is measured from the outside of one flange to the outside of the other flange. The spacing determines the width of the wheel, as well as the type of hub and wheel that can be used. The spacing is typically measured in millimeters, although some hubs may be measured in inches.</p>

<h2>Why is Hub Spacing Important?</h2>

<p>Hub spacing is important for several reasons. First, the hub spacing determines the width of the wheel. If the hub spacing is not correct, the wheel will not fit properly. Second, the hub spacing determines the type of hub and wheel that can be used. Different hubs have different spacing requirements and will not fit on a wheel with the wrong spacing. Finally, hub spacing affects the strength and durability of the wheel. If the hub spacing is not correct, the wheel may not be as strong or durable as it should be.</p>

<h2>How to Measure Hub Spacing</h2>

<p>Measuring hub spacing is not difficult, but it does require some precision. First, you will need to remove the wheel from the bike. Once the wheel is removed, you will need to measure the distance between the two flanges of the hub. The best way to do this is to use a caliper or vernier caliper. Simply place the caliper on the flange and measure the distance between the two flanges.</p>

<h2>Types of Hub Spacing</h2>

<p>There are several different types of hub spacing. The most common type of hub spacing is “quick release” (QR) spacing. This type of spacing is typically used on mountain and road bikes. The spacing is typically 100mm for the front wheel and 135mm for the rear wheel. Other types of hub spacing include “thru-axle” (TA) spacing, which is typically used on mountain bikes, and “track” (TK) spacing, which is typically used on track bikes.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Understanding hub spacing is essential for anyone who is building or replacing a wheel. Hub spacing determines the width of the wheel, the type of hub and wheel that can be used, and the strength and durability of the wheel. Measuring hub spacing is not difficult, but it does require some precision. There are several different types of hub spacing, including quick release, thru-axle, and track spacing. By taking the time to understand hub spacing, you can ensure that your wheel is safe and secure.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I use a hub with the wrong spacing?</h3>

<p>No, you cannot use a hub with the wrong spacing. Different hubs have different spacing requirements and will not fit on a wheel with the wrong spacing.</p>

<h3>Are there any safety concerns with using the wrong hub spacing?</h3>

<p>Yes, there are safety concerns with using the wrong hub spacing. If the hub spacing is not correct, the wheel may not be as strong or durable as it should be, which could lead to a potential safety hazard.</p>

<h3>What if I don't know the exact hub spacing?</h3>

<p>If you don't know the exact hub spacing, you can measure the distance between the two flanges of the hub using a caliper or vernier caliper. This will give you an accurate measurement of the hub spacing.</p>

<h3>Can I use different types of hubs on the same wheel?</h3>

<p>No, you cannot use different types of hubs on the same wheel. Different types of hubs have different spacing requirements and will not fit on a wheel with the wrong spacing.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits of using the correct hub spacing?</h3>

<p>Using the correct hub spacing has several benefits. First, it ensures that the wheel fits properly. Second, it ensures that the type of hub and wheel that can be used is compatible with the hub. Finally, it ensures that the wheel is strong and durable.</p>
