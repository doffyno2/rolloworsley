A leaking Moen shower head can be a real nuisance. Not only does it waste water, but it can also cause water damage to the walls and floors of your bathroom. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to repair a leaking Moen shower head. Read on to learn how to repair a leaking Moen shower head.

<h2>Step 1: Shut off the Water Supply</h2>

The first step in repairing a leaking Moen shower head is to shut off the water supply. You can do this by turning off the main water supply or by turning off the valve at the base of the shower head.

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Shower Head</h2>

Once the water supply is shut off, the next step is to remove the shower head. To do this, you will need a wrench or pliers. Place the wrench or pliers around the base of the shower head and rotate counterclockwise until it is loose. Once the shower head is loose, pull it away from the wall.

<h2>Step 3: Inspect the Shower Head</h2>

Now itâ€™s time to inspect the shower head. Look for any cracks or other signs of damage. If you find any, replace the shower head. If not, proceed to the next step.

<h2>Step 4: Clean the Shower Head</h2>

If there are no cracks or other damage to the shower head, the next step is to clean it. Using a soft cloth, gently wipe away any dirt, grime, or mineral deposits that may have built up on the shower head.

<h2>Step 5: Replace the O-ring</h2>

The O-ring is a small rubber ring that is located near the base of the shower head. Over time, this O-ring can become worn or cracked. If this is the case, the O-ring should be replaced. To do this, you will need a new O-ring and a pair of needle-nose pliers.

<h2>Step 6: Reinstall the Shower Head</h2>

Once the O-ring has been replaced, the next step is to reinstall the shower head. Make sure to line up the threads on the shower head and the pipe before you start to screw it in. Once the shower head is in place, turn the water supply back on and check for leaks.
