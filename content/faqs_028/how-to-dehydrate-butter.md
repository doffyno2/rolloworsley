<p>Dehydrating butter is a simple process that takes just a few steps and some basic kitchen equipment. With a food dehydrator, you can easily store butter for months without it going bad.

<p>Dehydrated butter can be used in many recipes, such as sauces and soups, as well as for baking and cooking.

<h3>Step 2: Spread the Butter in a Single Layer</h3>
