<p>Bike drifting is one of the most exhilarating experiences you can have on two wheels. It involves taking your bike to the extreme limits of its handling, maneuvering it with subtle inputs and counter-steering, and creating a controlled slide. To drift a bike, you need to be in control, patient, and have a great sense of balance. With the right technique, you can learn how to drift a bike and take your riding to the next level.</p>

<h2>What is Bike Drifting?</h2>

<p>Bike drifting involves taking your bike to the edge of its handling abilities and allowing it to slide, or drift, through a corner. This is done by applying the brakes and counter-steering, which allows the rear wheel to break away from the front wheel and slide. It takes a lot of skill and practice to master this technique, as you need to be in full control of the bike at all times.</p>

<h2>The Basics of Bike Drifting</h2>

<p>Bike drifting starts with the right setup and technique. You need a bike that is well balanced, with stiff suspension, good tires, and a strong frame. You also need to know how to counter-steer, which is a technique where you turn the handlebars in the opposite direction of the direction you want to go. This will cause the rear wheel to break away from the front wheel and slide, allowing you to control the drift.</p>

<h2>Drifting Through a Corner</h2>

<p>Once you have the right setup and technique, you can begin to drift through a corner. To do this, you need to approach the corner at a steady speed and apply the brakes before entering the corner. As the bike starts to turn, you need to counter-steer and lean into the corner. This will cause the rear wheel to lose traction and slide, allowing you to control the drift. You can then use your body weight and throttle control to adjust the angle of the drift and control the bike.</p>

<h2>Practicing Your Drifting Technique</h2>

<p>It takes a lot of practice to perfect your drifting technique. Start by practicing on a flat surface and gradually work your way up to corners. When practicing in a corner, start by going slow and gradually increase your speed as you become more confident. Be sure to take your time and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Once you have mastered the basics of drifting, you can start to experiment with different techniques and find your own style.</p>

<h2>Safety Tips for Drifting</h2>

<p>Drifting is an extreme sport and should be done with caution. Wear the proper protective gear, including a helmet, elbow pads, and knee pads. Also, be sure to stay within your limits and don't push yourself too hard. It's important to practice in a safe environment and never attempt to drift in traffic.</p>
