<p>Maintaining a riding mower is an important part of keeping your lawn looking its best. One of the essential tasks of mower maintenance is adjusting the valves. Valves are small parts inside the engine that allow air and fuel to mix and ignite, and they need to be adjusted periodically to ensure the engine is running smoothly and efficiently. Adjusting the valves on your riding mower isn't a difficult task, but it is important to understand the process before attempting it.</p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies Needed</h2>

<p>Before attempting to adjust the valves on your riding mower, you'll need to make sure you have the right tools and supplies on hand. You'll need a valve adjustment tool, a flat-head screwdriver, a hammer, a ruler, and a rag or cloth. You'll also need a can of engine oil or a valve adjustment oil, depending on what type of mower you have. Additionally, you'll need a pair of safety glasses, a torque wrench, and a valve adjustment feeler gauge.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Mower</h2>

<p>Before you begin adjusting the valves, you'll need to get your riding mower ready. First, disconnect the spark plug wires from the spark plugs and remove the air filter. Then, remove the valve cover and set it aside. Next, make sure the engine is cool and at rest before you begin.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Valves</h2>

<p>Once the mower is prepared, you can begin adjusting the valves. Start by turning the valve adjuster screw with the flat-head screwdriver until it is just slightly loose. Then, use the valve adjustment tool to turn the valve adjuster screw until it is snug. After you have adjusted the valve adjuster screw, reattach the valve cover and reconnect the spark plug wires.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Test the Mower</h2>

<p>Once the valves have been adjusted, it's important to test the mower to make sure it is running properly. Start by adding the engine oil or valve adjustment oil to the engine, then start the mower and let it run for a few minutes. After the mower has been running for a few minutes, turn it off and check the valve adjustment feeler gauge. If the feeler gauge is within the manufacturer's specifications, then the valves have been adjusted properly.</p>
