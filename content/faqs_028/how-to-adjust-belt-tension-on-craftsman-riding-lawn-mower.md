<h2>Introduction: Why Adjust Belt Tension?</h2>

Having a properly adjusted belt tension is essential for any riding lawn mower. Without proper tension, the engine will not run as efficiently, and the mower’s performance will suffer. Additionally, an improperly adjusted belt could cause excessive wear and tear on the engine, leading to costly repairs. For these reasons, it is important to ensure that the belt tension is adjusted properly on a Craftsman riding lawn mower.

<h2>Step 1: Locate the Belt Tensioner</h2>

The first step in adjusting the belt tension is to locate the belt tensioner. On most Craftsman riding lawn mowers, the belt tensioner is located near the rear of the engine, on the right side. The tensioner is typically a metal arm connected to a pulley.

<h2>Step 2: Test the Tension</h2>

Once the belt tensioner has been located, the next step is to test the tension. To do this, place your hand on the belt and press down. If the belt gives more than an inch when pressed, then it is too loose and needs to be tightened. If the belt does not move at all, then it is too tight and needs to be loosened.

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Belt Tension</h2>

Once the belt tension has been tested, the next step is to adjust it. To do this, locate the tensioner adjustment knob. This knob can usually be found near the belt tensioner. Turning the knob clockwise will increase the tension, while turning it counterclockwise will decrease the tension.

<h2>Step 4: Test the Tension Again</h2>

Once the belt tension has been adjusted, it is important to test the tension again. This is to ensure that the tension is correct. To test the tension, press down on the belt with your hand. If the belt gives more than an inch when pressed, then it is too loose and needs to be tightened. If the belt does not move at all, then it is too tight and needs to be loosened. 

<h2>Step 5: Re-Install the Mower Deck</h2>

Once the belt tension has been adjusted and tested, the next step is to re-install the mower deck. To do this, make sure the mower deck is properly aligned with the belt tensioner and secure it with the bolts. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Adjusting the belt tension on a Craftsman riding lawn mower is an important part of regular maintenance. It is essential for ensuring that the mower runs efficiently and prevents excessive wear and tear on the engine. By following the above steps, you can easily adjust the belt tension on your Craftsman riding lawn mower.
