<h2>How to Make Homemade Corn Dogs without Baking Powder</h2>

Making your own corn dogs is relatively easy and doesn’t require too much effort. Here’s how to do it:

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Batter</h3>

In a large mixing bowl, combine the cornmeal, flour, salt, and sugar. Whisk until all the ingredients are combined. In a separate bowl, beat the egg and add the milk. Whisk until the mixture is smooth. Slowly add the egg and milk mixture to the dry ingredients, whisking as you add it. Continue whisking until the batter is smooth.

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Hot Dogs</h3>

Take the hot dogs and insert a skewer into each one. This will help the hot dogs stay in place when you dip them in the batter.

<h3>Step 3: Fry the Corn Dogs</h3>

Heat the vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large pot. Once the oil is hot, carefully dip each hot dog into the batter and then place it into the hot oil. Fry the corn dogs for 3-4 minutes, or until they are golden brown. Use tongs to remove the corn dogs from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels.

<h3>Step 4: Serve!</h3>

Serve your homemade corn dogs with your favorite condiments and enjoy!

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I Use Baking Powder in Corn Dogs?</h3>

<h3>What Other Ingredients Can I Add to Corn Dog Batter?</h3>

You can add a variety of ingredients to your corn dog batter, depending on your tastes. Common additions include garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper. You can also add shredded cheese or jalapenos for an extra kick.

<h3>How Do I Know When the Corn Dogs Are Done?</h3>
