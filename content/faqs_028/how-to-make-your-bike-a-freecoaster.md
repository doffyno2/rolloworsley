<p>The freecoaster is a relatively new concept in the world of BMX biking. It’s a type of hub that allows the rider to coast backward without having to pedal or engage the brakes. The advantages of this hub include improved control and the ability to perform more complex tricks. It’s also a great way to improve your overall riding experience. In this article, we’ll explain how to make your bike a freecoaster and the advantages of having one.</p>

<h2>What Is a Freecoaster?</h2>

<p>A freecoaster is a type of BMX hub that enables the rider to coast backward without having to pedal or engage the brakes. This type of hub features a ratchet system that allows the rider to coast backward without having to pedal or engage the brakes. This system is similar to the mechanism used in fixed-gear bicycles.</p>

<p>The freecoaster hub has two sets of ratchets that are linked together. The outer set, which is connected to the sprocket, is responsible for engaging the pedals, while the inner set, which is connected to the rear wheel, is responsible for engaging the brakes. When the rider wants to coast backward, they can simply unclip the chain from the sprocket and coast backward without having to pedal or engage the brakes.</p>

<h2>Benefits of a Freecoaster</h2>

<p>The freecoaster offers a number of advantages over traditional BMX hubs. The most obvious benefit is that it allows the rider to coast backward without having to pedal or engage the brakes. This greatly improves the rider’s control, as it eliminates the need to pedal and brake in order to keep the bike moving in the desired direction.</p>

<p>The freecoaster also makes it easier to perform more complex tricks. The ability to coast backward is an essential part of certain tricks, such as tailwhips and barspins. With the freecoaster, these tricks are much easier to perform, as the rider doesn’t have to pedal or engage the brakes in order to keep the bike moving in the desired direction.</p>

<p>Finally, the freecoaster can also improve the overall riding experience. By eliminating the need to pedal and brake in order to keep the bike moving in the desired direction, the rider is free to focus more on their tricks and riding style. This makes for a more enjoyable and rewarding experience.</p>

<h2>How to Make Your Bike a Freecoaster</h2>

<p>The process of making your bike a freecoaster is relatively simple. The first step is to purchase a freecoaster hub. These hubs are available from a variety of online retailers and BMX shops. Once you’ve purchased the hub, you’ll need to remove the current hub from your bike.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll need to install the freecoaster onto your bike. This process is relatively simple, as all you need to do is attach the hub to the wheel and tighten the bolts. After that, you’ll need to attach the chain to the sprocket and adjust the tension so that it is tight enough to stay in place.</p>

<p>Once the freecoaster is installed, you’ll need to adjust the brakes. This process is relatively simple, as all you need to do is adjust the tension on the brake cable so that it is tight enough to provide adequate braking. Finally, you’ll need to adjust the chain tension so that it is tight enough to stay in place while you’re riding.</p>

<p>Once the freecoaster is installed and adjusted, you’re ready to go. With the freecoaster, you can now coast backward without having to engage the brakes or pedal. This can greatly improve your overall riding experience, as it eliminates the need to pedal and brake in order to keep the bike moving in the desired direction.</p>
