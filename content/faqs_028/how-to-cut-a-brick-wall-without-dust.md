Cutting brick walls can be a tricky and dusty business, but with the right tools and techniques, it can be done quickly, safely and without a lot of mess.

To use a masonry chisel and hammer, you’ll need to mark the area you want to cut with a pencil. Then, with a steady hand, use a masonry chisel and hammer to gently chip away at the brick. This method is slower than using a saw, but it’s also much quieter and creates less dust.
