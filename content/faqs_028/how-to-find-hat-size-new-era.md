<p>New Era hats are incredibly popular and fashionable, however, finding the right size can be a challenge. New Era hats come in a range of sizes from 6 7/8 to 8, and it’s important to know your size before buying one. In this article, we’ll be discussing how to find the right size New Era hat for you.</p>

<h2>Measuring Your Head for a New Era Hat</h2>

<p>The first step to finding the right size New Era hat is to measure your head. You can do this by wrapping a measuring tape around your head, just above your ears. Make sure to keep the tape snug, but not too tight. Once you’ve measured your head, you’ll have your hat size in inches. You can then use the following chart to determine your corresponding New Era hat size:</p>

<h3>New Era Hat Size Chart</h3>

<ul>
<li>6 7/8 – 21 1/2"</li>
<li>7 – 21 5/8"</li>
<li>7 1/8 – 22"</li> 
<li>7 1/4 – 22 3/8"</li> 
<li>7 3/8 – 22 3/4"</li>
<li>7 1/2 – 23 1/8"</li>
<li>7 5/8 – 23 1/2"</li>
<li>7 3/4 – 23 7/8"</li>
<li>7 7/8 – 24 1/4"</li>
<li>8 – 24 5/8"</li>
</ul>

<p>If your head measurement falls between sizes, it’s best to go with the larger size. For example, if your head measurement is 22 3/4”, you should go with size 7 3/8. It’s always better to go with the larger size as you can always adjust the fit of the hat with the adjustable strap at the back.</p>

<h2>Trying On a New Era Hat</h2>

<p>Once you’ve found your size, it’s time to try it on. When trying on a New Era hat, make sure that the front of the brim is level with your eyebrows. The back of the brim should rest just above your neck. The hat should fit snugly around the circumference of your head, with no gaps or tight spots. If the hat is too tight, you can adjust the adjustable strap at the back of the hat to loosen it. You should also make sure that the hat is comfortable and not too tight.</p>
