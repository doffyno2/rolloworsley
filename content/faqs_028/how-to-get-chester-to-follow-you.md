<p>It’s a common dream for many dog owners to have their pup follow them around like a little shadow. With just a few simple tips and tricks, you can get your pup to follow you everywhere you go. The key is to build a bond with your pup, be consistent, and practice patience. With a little perseverance, you can have Chester following you around like a little shadow in no time.</p>

<h2>Building a Bond with Your Dog</h2>

<p>In order for a dog to follow you, you must first build a bond with them. This bond is built on trust and respect. Spending quality time with your pup, engaging in interactive play and providing them with ample exercise will help to build a strong connection between the two of you. This strong connection is the foundation of your relationship and is essential if you want your pup to follow you.</p>

<h2>Being Consistent</h2>

<p>Once you have established a bond with your pup, you must be consistent in your approach. Dogs are creatures of habit and will respond best to consistency. Setting clear boundaries and expectations from the beginning will help your pup learn what is expected of them. If you are consistent in your approach and your pup knows what is expected of them, it will be much easier for them to follow you.</p>

<h2>Practice Patience</h2>

<p>Learning to follow you is not something that will happen overnight; it will take some time for your pup to learn. Be patient and don’t be discouraged if your pup doesn’t learn right away. Consistency, positive reinforcement, and patience are key when it comes to teaching your pup to follow you.</p>

<h2>Start Small</h2>

<p>It can be tempting to try to get your pup to follow you around the entire house right away, but it’s best to start small. Start with a simple command such as “follow” and have them follow you from one room to the next. As they become more comfortable with the command, you can increase the distance and complexity of the commands.</p>

<h2>Use Positive Reinforcement</h2>

<p>Positive reinforcement is one of the most effective ways to train your pup. Whenever your pup follows your command, be sure to give them lots of praise and rewards. This will help reinforce the positive behavior and help your pup learn more quickly.</p>
