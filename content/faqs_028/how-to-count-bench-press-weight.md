How to Count Bench Press Weight


Bench pressing is a popular exercise among gym goers, bodybuilders, and powerlifters alike. It is a great exercise for building strength and muscle mass, and it can also be used to increase your bench press max. Counting the amount of weight you are lifting can be a difficult task, especially when you are dealing with multiple plates. This article will provide you with some tips on how to count bench press weight correctly.

<h2> Understanding Plates and Weights </h2>

Before you can start counting the weight of your bench press, it is important to understand the different plates and weights that are used for bench pressing. The most common plates are 45-pound, 25-pound, 10-pound, and 5-pound plates. The most common weights used for bench pressing are 45 pounds, 25 pounds, and 10 pounds.

<h2> Counting the Weight </h2>

Once you understand the different plates and weights that are used for bench pressing, it is time to start counting the weight. Start by counting the number of plates on each side of the barbell. Then, multiply the number of plates on each side by the weight of the plate to get the total weight. For example, if you have two 45-pound plates on each side of the barbell, the total weight is 180 pounds.

<h2> Adding Weights </h2>

If you need to add more weight to the barbell, you can use smaller plates or collars. Smaller plates, such as 5-pound and 10-pound plates, can be added to the barbell to increase the total weight. Collars can also be used to add small amounts of weight to the barbell.

<h2> Subtracting Weights </h2>

If you need to subtract weight from the barbell, you can use smaller plates or collars. Smaller plates, such as 5-pound and 10-pound plates, can be removed from the barbell to decrease the total weight. Collars can also be removed to subtract small amounts of weight from the barbell.

<h2> Tips and Tricks </h2>

It is important to always double-check the weight of the barbell before you start bench pressing. This will ensure that you are lifting the correct amount of weight and that you are not putting yourself at risk of injury. Additionally, it is a good idea to use a spotter when bench pressing to help you count the weight and to spot you in case you fail to lift the weight.
