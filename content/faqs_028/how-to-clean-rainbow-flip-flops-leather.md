<p>Getting a new pair of leather flip flops is always exciting, especially when they come in a bold, eye-catching rainbow pattern. However, taking care of them can be a bit tricky. Caring for rainbow-colored leather flip flops requires a few extra steps, but it's worth it to keep them looking great.</p>
