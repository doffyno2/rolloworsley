When it comes to sunglasses, the logos and labels on the side of the frame can be quite distracting. Whether you don’t like the way it looks or you just want to take your sunglasses to the next level, removing the logo from the side of your sunglasses is a great way to customize your style and give your look a unique twist. But, it’s important to know the right way to do it so that you don’t damage your frames. In this article, we’ll go over the steps for how to remove logo from side of sunglasses.

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

Before you get started, you’ll need to make sure you have the right supplies. You’ll need the following items:

<ul>
  <li>A pair of sunglasses</li>
  <li>A damp cloth</li>
  <li>Rubbing alcohol</li>
  <li>Q-tips</li>
  <li>Dish soap</li>
  <li>A toothbrush</li>
  <li>Nail polish remover (optional)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Frames</h2>

Before you start removing the logo, it’s important to make sure that your frames are clean. Start by taking a damp cloth and wiping down the frames to remove any dirt or oil that could be on them. If there is any stubborn dirt or oil, you can use a bit of dish soap on the cloth to help loosen it up.

<h2>Step 2: Apply Rubbing Alcohol</h2>

Once the frames are clean, it’s time to apply rubbing alcohol. Take a Q-tip and dip it in the rubbing alcohol. Then, rub it on the logo. The alcohol will help to break down the glue and make it easier to remove.

<h2>Step 3: Scrub the Logo</h2>

Once the alcohol has had a chance to break down the glue, it’s time to start scrubbing. Take a toothbrush and start scrubbing at the logo. You may need to apply more alcohol as you go to help break down the glue. Continue to scrub until the logo is completely gone.

<h2>Step 4: Clean the Frames Again</h2>

Once the logo is gone, it’s time to clean the frames again. Take a damp cloth and wipe down the frames to remove any residue from the logo. If there are any stubborn spots, you can use a bit of dish soap on the cloth to help loosen them up.

<h2>Step 5: Apply Nail Polish Remover (Optional)</h2>

If the logo is still not completely gone after scrubbing and cleaning, you may need to use nail polish remover. Take a Q-tip and dip it in the nail polish remover. Then, apply it to the area where the logo was. The nail polish remover will help to break down any stubborn glue that may still be left behind.
