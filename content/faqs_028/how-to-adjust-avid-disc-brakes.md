Avid disc brakes are a popular choice for mountain bikers, providing reliable stopping power in a wide range of conditions. In order to ensure that your brakes are performing at their best, it is important to know how to properly adjust Avid disc brakes. This guide will explain the process in detail and provide some tips to get the most out of your brakes.

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

Before you can begin adjusting your Avid disc brakes, you will need a few tools to complete the job. These include a 4mm Allen key, a 5mm Allen key, and a flat-head screwdriver. You may also need a pair of needle-nose pliers, depending on the design of your brakes.

<h2>Step 1: Loosen the Brake Mount</h2>

The first step in the process is to loosen the brake mount. This is done by using the 4mm Allen key to loosen the two bolts located on the back of the brake mount. Once the bolts have been loosened, the brake mount should be able to move freely.

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Brake Pads</h2>

The next step is to adjust the brake pads. This is done by loosening the two 5mm Allen bolts located on the side of the brake caliper. Once these bolts have been loosened, the brake pads should be able to move freely.

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Lever Position</h2>

Once the brake pads have been adjusted, you can begin to adjust the lever position. This is done by using the flat-head screwdriver to loosen the two screws located on the side of the lever. Once these screws have been loosened, the lever should be able to move freely.

<h2>Step 4: Adjust the Spring Tension</h2>

The last step in the process is to adjust the spring tension. This is done by using the needle-nose pliers to adjust the tension on the springs located on the back of the brake caliper. Once the tension has been adjusted, the brakes should be ready for use.

<h2>Tips for Adjusting Avid Disc Brakes</h2>

Once you have adjusted your Avid disc brakes, there are a few tips to help keep them performing at their best. First, make sure that the brake pads are properly aligned with the rotor. This will ensure that the brakes are working efficiently and effectively. Additionally, make sure to check the spring tension periodically to ensure that it is at the proper level. Finally, make sure to clean and lubricate the brakes regularly to ensure that they are functioning properly.
