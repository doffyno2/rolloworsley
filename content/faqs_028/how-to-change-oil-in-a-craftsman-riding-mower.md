<p>If you own a Craftsman riding mower, you know that it requires regular maintenance to keep it running smoothly and safely. One of the most important maintenance tasks is changing the oil. Changing your oil regularly will keep your mower running efficiently and help extend its life. The following guide will help you learn how to change oil in a Craftsman riding mower.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>

<p>To change the oil in your Craftsman riding mower, you will need the following tools and materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oil filter wrench</li>
  <li>Oil drain pan</li>
  <li>New oil</li>
  <li>Funnel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Mower</h2>

<p>Before you begin, make sure that your mower is parked on a flat, level surface. Engage the parking brake and turn off the engine. Wait for the engine to cool before beginning.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Locate the Oil Drain Plug</h2>

<p>Look for the oil drain plug at the bottom of the engine. It will be located near the oil filter. Make sure that the oil drain pan is placed beneath the drain plug before you remove it.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Drain the Oil</h2>

<p>Once the oil drain pan is in place, use an oil filter wrench to loosen and remove the oil drain plug. Allow the used oil to drain completely. Replace the oil drain plug and tighten it securely.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Replace the Oil Filter</h2>

<p>Locate the oil filter, which should be mounted on the side of the engine. Use the oil filter wrench to loosen and remove the filter. Make sure to dispose of the old filter properly. Replace the filter with a new one, and tighten it securely.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Fill the Mower With Oil</h2>

<p>Using a funnel, pour the new oil into the oil fill cap. Make sure not to overfill. Check the oil level on the dipstick and add more oil if necessary. Replace the oil fill cap.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Start the Mower and Check for Leaks</h2>

<p>Once the oil has been changed, start the mower and let it run for a few minutes. Check for any oil leaks around the drain plug or oil filter. If no leaks are present, your mower is ready to use.</p>
