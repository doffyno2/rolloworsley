Skydiving is an adrenaline-filled activity that is growing in popularity. It is an exhilarating experience that many people dream of trying out. It is no wonder that more and more people are asking the question “How old do you have to be to go skydiving in California?” 

<h2>Skydiving in California</h2>

California is a great place to go skydiving due to its mild climate and abundance of skydiving locations. Whether you choose to go to San Diego, Los Angeles, or even up to the Bay area, you can experience the thrill of skydiving in California. 

In order to go skydiving in California, you must be at least 18 years old. This rule is the same for all of the other states in the US. This is a rule that is strictly enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The reason for this is that skydiving is considered to be a dangerous activity and requires a certain level of maturity and understanding to be able to safely complete a skydive. 

<h2>Skydiving Regulations in California</h2>

In addition to being at least 18 years old, there are other regulations that must be followed in order to go skydiving in California. All skydiving schools in the state must be registered and certified with the FAA. This means that they must adhere to the safety regulations set forth by the FAA. 

Skydivers must also be in good health and pass a physical exam prior to jumping. Those with heart or respiratory conditions, or who are pregnant, are not allowed to skydive in California. 

<h2>Experience Requirements</h2>

Skydivers in California must also have a certain level of experience before they can jump. The FAA requires that skydivers must have completed at least three jumps in the last twelve months, or a minimum of one hundred jumps in the last five years. This is to ensure that the skydiver is familiar with the equipment, the regulations, and the safety procedures that must be followed while skydiving. 

It is also important to note that all skydivers in California must be accompanied by an experienced skydiver who is at least eighteen years old. This experienced skydiver must be certified with the FAA and must be able to safely guide the skydiver through the skydive. 

<h2>What to Expect During a Skydive</h2>

When you go skydiving in California, you can expect a thrilling experience. You will be taken up in an airplane to an altitude of about 10,000 feet. Once you reach this altitude, it is time to jump out of the plane! You will be securely attached to an experienced skydiver and the two of you will freefall for approximately 60 seconds. During this time, you will experience the sensation of weightlessness and a sense of freedom. 

Once the parachute is deployed, you will experience the sensation of floating in the sky as you glide down to the ground. The entire skydive should take about 10-15 minutes, depending on the weather conditions.
