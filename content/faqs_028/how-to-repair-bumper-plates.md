How to Repair Bumper Plates

Bumper plates, or Olympic weightlifting plates, are a key component of any weight room. They are designed to be dropped from a height and bounce back to their original shape. However, over time and with heavy use, bumper plates can become damaged, making them difficult to use. Fortunately, it is possible to repair bumper plates to get them back in working order. In this article, we'll explain the steps necessary to safely and correctly repair bumper plates.

<h2>Assessment and Preparation</h2>
Before attempting to repair a damaged bumper plate, it is important to assess the damage. If the plate is cracked, chipped, or broken, it should not be used and should be replaced. However, if the plate is merely dented or slightly damaged, it can usually be repaired.

The next step is to disassemble the plate. Remove any screws, clips, or other components that are attached to the plate. Do not attempt to repair a plate while it is still attached to the barbell.

<h2>Cleaning and Sanding</h2>
Once the plate is disassembled, it is important to thoroughly clean it. Use a soft cloth to wipe off any dirt or debris. Once the plate is clean, use a medium-grit sandpaper to sand down any rough edges or burrs. This will help ensure that the plate is smooth and even.

<h2>Filling and Sealing</h2>
Once the plate is sanded down, it is time to fill in any gaps or indentations. Use a rubber cement or epoxy to fill in any dents or scratches. Allow the cement or epoxy to dry completely, then sand down any excess material.

<h2>Painting and Finishing</h2>
Once the plate is filled and sanded, it is time to paint and finish it. Use a paint designed specifically for bumper plates. Apply two to three coats of paint, allowing each coat to dry completely before applying the next one. Once the paint has dried, use a clear sealant to seal the plate and protect it from wear and tear.

<h2>Reassembly</h2>
Once the plate has been painted and sealed, it is time to reassemble it. If any parts were removed, make sure to reattach them securely. Once the plate is fully assembled, it is ready to be used again.
