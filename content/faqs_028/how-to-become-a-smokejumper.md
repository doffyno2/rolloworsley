Smokejumpers are highly trained wildland fire fighters who parachute from airplanes into remote areas, often to battle large, intense fires. Becoming a smokejumper is no small feat; it requires extensive training, physical fitness, and a great deal of determination. In this article, we will look at the steps you need to take to become a smokejumper.

<h2>What is Smokejumping?</h2>

Smokejumping is a type of wildland firefighting in which firefighters parachute from an airplane into remote areas to battle wildland fires. The smokejumpers are usually the first on the scene of a fire, and they are essential in getting it under control quickly and efficiently. Smokejumpers are highly trained and physically fit individuals who must be able to work under intense conditions and in extreme environments.

<h2>Requirements to Become a Smokejumper</h2>

There are a few requirements that must be met in order to become a smokejumper. First, you must be at least 18 years of age and have a high school diploma or GED. You must also have an excellent physical condition and be willing to work long hours in extreme conditions. Additionally, you must have a valid driver’s license and be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

<h2>Training and Education</h2>

Smokejumpers must complete a rigorous training program in order to become certified. Training usually takes place at a smokejumper base camp and can last up to two weeks. During this time, smokejumpers are taught the basics of wildland firefighting, such as fire suppression techniques, aerial navigation, and communication. They are also trained in the use of firefighting equipment and must become certified in first aid and CPR.

<h2>Physical Fitness and Health Requirements</h2>

In addition to the training and education requirements, smokejumpers must also meet certain physical fitness and health standards. These standards include being able to run 2 miles in less than 18 minutes, being able to swim at least 400 meters in under 10 minutes, and being able to complete other physical tests with a score of at least 70%. Smokejumpers must also be able to pass a physical examination and drug test.

<h2>Application Process</h2>

Once the training and education requirements have been met, prospective smokejumpers must complete an application process. The application process usually involves submitting an application, a resume, and a cover letter. Applicants must also complete an oral interview and a physical agility test. Once the application is approved, smokejumpers must complete a series of jumps in order to become certified.
