Apple Watch is an incredibly popular smartwatch that has become a staple of many people’s lives. It can be used for more than just telling time; it can also track your steps, monitor your heart rate, and more. Unfortunately, with all of the wear and tear that comes with its many uses, it can be easily scratched. But don’t worry, this article will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to repair scratches on Apple Watch face.

<h2>What You Will Need to Repair Scratches on Apple Watch</h2>

Before you begin repairing scratches on your Apple Watch, there are a few tools you will need. The first is a soft cloth, preferably microfiber, that is not abrasive. You will also need a soft-bristled toothbrush, rubbing alcohol, baking soda, and a toothpick. 

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide for Repairing a Scratched Apple Watch Face</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Clean the Screen</h3>

The first step in repairing scratches on your Apple Watch face is to clean the screen. Use the soft cloth to remove any dirt and debris from the face of the watch. Make sure the cloth is dry, as using a damp cloth can cause damage to the screen.

<h3>Step 2: Create a Baking Soda Paste</h3>

Once the screen is clean, mix together a paste using baking soda and a few drops of water. The paste should have a thick, paste-like consistency. 

<h3>Step 3: Apply the Paste</h3>

Using the soft-bristled toothbrush, apply the baking soda paste to the scratched area. Gently scrub in small circles and be sure to keep the paste wet. If the paste begins to dry out, simply add a few drops of water. 

<h3>Step 4: Rinse the Paste Away</h3>

Once you have finished scrubbing, rinse the baking soda paste off of your Apple Watch face using the soft cloth. 

<h3>Step 5: Wipe Down with Rubbing Alcohol</h3>

Next, use a cotton swab saturated with rubbing alcohol to wipe down the scratched area. This will help to remove any leftover residue from the baking soda paste. 

<h3>Step 6: Use a Toothpick to Remove Debris</h3>

Once the area has been wiped down with rubbing alcohol, you can use a toothpick to remove any debris from the scratched area. Be sure to be gentle and do not press too hard, as this can cause further damage.
