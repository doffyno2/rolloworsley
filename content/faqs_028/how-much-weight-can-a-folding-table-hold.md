<p>Folding tables are a great, portable way to add seating in your home, office or other space. They are lightweight, easy to store and can be transported from place to place with ease. But one of the most common questions when it comes to folding tables is: How much weight can they hold?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends largely on the type of folding table you have. Different materials, shapes and sizes will determine how much weight a folding table can hold. It’s important to understand the limitations of your particular folding table before loading it up with heavy items. In this article, we’ll explore the different types of folding tables and the weight limits they can safely hold.</p>

<h2>Types of Folding Tables</h2>

<p>The most common types of folding tables are made from wood, plastic and metal. Each of these materials has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to weight capacity.</p> 

<h3>Wood Folding Tables</h3>

They are strong and sturdy, and can usually hold up to 150 lbs. of weight. However, it is important to note that wood folding tables should not be exposed to moisture or water, as this can cause them to warp over time.</p>

<h3>Plastic Folding Tables</h3>

<p>Plastic folding tables are a popular choice for those looking for a lightweight, inexpensive table. They are made from a variety of plastics, such as polypropylene and ABS. Plastic folding tables are strong and durable, and can usually hold up to 100 lbs. of weight. However, they are not as strong as wood tables and can be more prone to breaking if overloaded.</p>

Metal folding tables are often used in commercial settings, such as cafeterias or event venues. They are durable and long-lasting, and can withstand a lot of wear and tear.</p>

<h2>Factors That Determine Weight Limit</h2>

<p>Whether you’re using a wood, plastic or metal folding table, it’s important to remember that there are several factors that can affect how much weight it can safely hold. These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Table size: The larger the table, the more weight it can hold.</li>
  <li>Table shape: Rectangular and square tables can hold more weight than round tables.</li>
  <li>Table legs: More legs on a table will provide more support and stability, and allow it to hold more weight.</li>
  <li>Table material: As mentioned above, different materials can hold different amounts of weight.</li>
</ul>
