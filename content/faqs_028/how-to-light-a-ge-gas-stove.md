How to Light a GE Gas Stove

Gas stoves are becoming increasingly popular in households, as they provide a convenient and quick way to cook meals. Although using a gas stove is relatively easy, it is important to understand how to light one properly. This guide will provide step-by-step instructions on how to light a GE gas stove, as well as some safety tips. 

<h2>Steps to Light a GE Gas Stove</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Area</h3>
Before attempting to light your gas stove, make sure to clear the area of any flammable materials. This includes paper, fabric, and other combustible items. Additionally, make sure the area is well ventilated. 

<h3>Step 2: Locate the Gas Valve</h3>
On the back of the stove, locate the gas valve. This is usually located near the top of the stove, and is usually a black knob. Turn the knob counterclockwise. 

<h3>Step 3: Start the Flame</h3>
Once the gas valve has been opened, press the igniter button on the stove to start the gas burner. The igniter button is usually a small red or black button located near the gas valve. When the igniter is pressed, it will create a spark that will then light the gas burner. 

<h3>Step 4: Adjust the Flame</h3>
Once the gas burner is lit, you can adjust the flame to your desired setting. This is usually done by turning the knob clockwise to increase the flame intensity, or counterclockwise to decrease the flame intensity. 

<h3>Step 5: Extinguish the Flame</h3>
When you are done using the gas burner, make sure to turn off the gas valve by turning the knob clockwise. This will shut off the gas flow and extinguish the flame.
