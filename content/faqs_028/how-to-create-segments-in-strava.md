<p>Strava is a popular online platform for tracking and analyzing activities such as running and cycling. With Strava, you can track your progress and compare data with friends and other athletes. The platform also allows you to create segments, or portions of your route, which can be used to compare with others. In this article, we'll show you how to create segments in Strava.</p>

<h2>What is a Segment?</h2>

<p>A segment is a portion of your route that you can track. You can create a segment to compare your performance against other athletes or your own records. For example, you can create a segment of a hill climb or a sprint segment on a flat stretch of road. You can also create segments to compare with friends or to see how you compare against the general population. Segments can be used to set personal records or to compete against others.</p>

<h2>How to Create a Segment in Strava</h2>

<p>Creating a segment in Strava is easy. The first step is to log into Strava and select the activity that you want to use to create the segment. Once you’ve selected an activity, you’ll be presented with a map of your route. On the map, you can zoom in and out and move around to find the section of your route that you want to use as a segment. Once you’ve found the section of the route that you want to use, click the ‘+’ symbol to create a new segment.</p>

<h2>Naming Your Segment</h2>

<p>Once you’ve selected the portion of the route that you want to use as a segment, you can give the segment a name. You can name the segment whatever you want, but it’s a good idea to use a descriptive name so that you can easily identify the segment later. For example, if you’re creating a segment for a hill climb, you might name it ‘Hill Climb Segment’ or ‘Hill Climb #1’.</p>

<h2>Setting the Distance of Your Segment</h2>

<p>Once you’ve named your segment, you can set the distance of the segment. You can choose from a number of pre-set distances, or you can enter a custom distance. You can also choose to have Strava automatically determine the distance of the segment by using the map.</p>

<h2>Saving Your Segment</h2>

<p>Once you’ve named and set the distance of your segment, you can save it. When you save your segment, Strava will create a leaderboard for the segment. You can use the leaderboard to see how you compare against other athletes on the segment or to see how your performance changes over time.</p>

<h2>Sharing Your Segment</h2>

<p>Once you’ve created your segment, you can share it with other athletes. You can share your segment with your friends or with the public. When you share your segment, other athletes will be able to compare their performance against yours and compete for the best time on the segment.</p>
