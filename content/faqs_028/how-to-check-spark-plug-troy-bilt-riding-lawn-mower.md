<p>If you own a Troy Bilt riding lawn mower, you’ll want to make sure that the spark plug is in good working condition. A faulty spark plug can cause your mower to run poorly and can even prevent it from starting at all. Here’s how to check the spark plug in a Troy Bilt riding lawn mower. </p>

<h2>Steps to Check the Spark Plug in a Troy Bilt Riding Lawn Mower</h2>

<p>There are a few steps involved in checking the spark plug in a Troy Bilt riding lawn mower. Before you begin, make sure that the engine is off and that the spark plug wire is disconnected. </p>

<h3>Step 1: Disconnect the Spark Plug Wire</h3>

<p>The first step is to disconnect the spark plug wire from the spark plug. To do this, locate the spark plug wire and pull it off. This will allow you to inspect the spark plug without any interference from the spark plug wire.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Inspect the Spark Plug for Damage</h3>

<p>Once the spark plug wire is disconnected, you can inspect the spark plug for any signs of damage. Look for cracks, warping, or any other signs of damage. If the spark plug looks damaged, it’s best to replace it with a new one.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Clean the Spark Plug</h3>

<p>If the spark plug is not damaged, the next step is to clean it. You can do this by using a spark plug cleaner or a wire brush. This will help to remove any dirt or debris that may be preventing the spark plug from firing correctly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Check the Gap</h3>

<p>The next step is to check the gap on the spark plug. The gap should be between 0.030 and 0.060 inches. If the gap is too wide, you can use a feeler gauge to adjust it. If the gap is too narrow, you may need to replace the spark plug.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Reattach the Spark Plug Wire</h3>

<p>Once you’ve inspected and cleaned the spark plug, it’s time to reattach the spark plug wire. Make sure that the wire is firmly attached and that there are no signs of damage. Once the wire is connected, you can start the engine and test the spark plug.</p>
