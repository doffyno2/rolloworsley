<p>For many homeowners, their garage is not just a place to store their tools and vehicles. It can also be a home office, a workshop, or a place to store recreational items. But regardless of what you're using it for, you will likely need to have access to the internet. Unfortunately, most garages are detached from the main house, which means that extending your wifi signal can be a challenge. Luckily, there are a few ways that you can extend your wifi to your detached garage and make sure that you can access the internet from wherever you are.</p>

<h2>Extend Your Network With Mesh Wifi</h2>

<p>Mesh wifi is an excellent option for extending your wifi signal to your detached garage. Mesh wifi systems are made up of multiple nodes, or access points, that are placed around your home. Each node is connected to the internet, so they can all work together to extend your network. In order to extend your wifi to your detached garage, all you need to do is place a node in the garage. This will create a mesh network that will extend your signal over a larger area. Mesh wifi systems are also easy to set up and use, so it won't take long to get your garage connected.</p>

<h2>Install an Access Point</h2>

<p>If you don't want to invest in a mesh wifi system, you can also install an access point in your detached garage. An access point is a device that takes a wifi signal and rebroadcasts it, allowing you to extend your network. To install an access point in your detached garage, you will need to run a Cat5 or Cat6 cable from your router to the access point. This can be done by running the cable through the walls or ceiling, or you can also use a wireless bridge to extend the signal. Once the access point is installed, you can easily extend your wifi to your detached garage.</p>

<h2>Use a Powerline Network</h2>

<p>A powerline network is another way to extend your wifi to your detached garage. A powerline network uses your home's existing electrical wiring to transmit a wifi signal. To use a powerline network, you will need two adapters: one for the router and one for the garage. The two adapters will connect to each other over the electrical wiring, creating a secure connection. This will allow you to extend your wifi to your detached garage without running any cables.</p>

<h2>Boost Your Wifi Signal With a Range Extender</h2>

<p>Range extenders are devices that boost your existing wifi signal, allowing you to extend your network over a larger area. Range extenders are easy to install and use, and they are relatively inexpensive. To use a range extender, you will need to place it between your router and the garage. The range extender will boost the signal, allowing you to extend your wifi to your detached garage.</p>
