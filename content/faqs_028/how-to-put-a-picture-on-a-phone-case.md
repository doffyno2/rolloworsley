<h2>What Do I Need?</h2>

<p>In order to put a picture on your phone case, you'll need a few items. First, you'll need a phone case that is compatible with your device. You'll also need a photo or design to use.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Putting a Picture on Your Phone Case</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Choose Your Photo or Design</h3>

<p>The first step in putting a picture on your phone case is to decide what you want to use. You can choose a picture of yourself or a loved one, or a design or logo that you like. Make sure that the photo or design you choose is high-resolution and clear. Once you have chosen your photo or design, you can print it out or save it to your computer.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Phone Case</h3>

<p>The next step is to prepare your phone case for the picture. Make sure that the case is clean and free of dust and debris. This will help ensure that the adhesive sticks properly to the case. If there is any dirt or debris on the case, use a damp cloth to remove it.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Apply the Adhesive</h3>

<p>Once your phone case is clean and dry, it's time to apply the adhesive. Make sure that you use an adhesive that is appropriate for the material of your phone case. Apply the adhesive evenly to the back of the photo or design, and then carefully place it onto the phone case. Make sure that the photo or design is straight and positioned correctly.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Allow the Adhesive to Dry</h3>
