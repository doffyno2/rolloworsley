The injured dog may also be reluctant to open their mouth, may have difficulty eating or drinking, and may have a visible deformity in the jaw area. Other signs of a broken jaw may include swelling, bruising, tenderness, difficulty breathing, and difficulty speaking. 

<h2>Diagnosis of a Broken Jaw</h2>

In order to diagnose a broken jaw, the veterinarian will perform a physical examination and take X-rays of the injured area. In some cases, the X-rays may reveal a fracture in the jawbone. If the jawbone is fractured, the veterinarian will likely recommend surgery to repair the injury. 

<h2>Treatment of a Broken Jaw</h2>

The treatment of a broken jaw depends on the severity of the injury. In most cases, surgery is recommended in order to repair the injury.
