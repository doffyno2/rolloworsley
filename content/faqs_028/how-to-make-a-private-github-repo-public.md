GitHub is a popular version control system used by developers and teams worldwide. With GitHub, you can collaborate on projects, store code, and share your work with others. By default, all repositories on GitHub are public, meaning anyone can view, clone, and download them. But sometimes you need to keep your code private. In this article, we'll explain how to make a private GitHub repo public.

<h2>What Is a Private GitHub Repo?</h2>

A private GitHub repository is a repository that is only accessible to its owner and collaborators. All other users are denied access to the repository. This is useful for projects that need to remain confidential, such as security-related projects or projects that contain sensitive information.

<h2>How to Make a Private GitHub Repo Public</h2>

Making a private GitHub repo public is a simple process. All you need to do is change the repository's visibility settings. Here's how:

<h3>Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository Settings</h3>

First, navigate to your repository's settings page. To do this, open the repository in GitHub and click on the "Settings" tab.

<h3>Step 2: Change the Visibility Settings</h3>

Once on the settings page, scroll down to the "Visibility" section. Here you will be able to choose between "Public" or "Private". Select "Public" to make your repository public.

<h3>Step 3: Confirm the Changes</h3>
