Oakley arms are a type of frame that can be easily adjusted to fit your face. They are designed to be comfortable and have a snug fit, so they are ideal for those who have had difficulty finding glasses that fit properly. If your Oakley arms are not fitting correctly, there are a few different ways you can fix them. 

<h2>Check the Nose Pads</h2>

The first step to fixing Oakley arms is to check the nose pads. If the nose pads are not fitting correctly, it can cause the arms to not fit properly. To check the nose pads, take a look at them from the front and compare them to the other pads on your glasses. If one of the pads is larger than the other, it could be causing the arms to not fit properly. You can easily adjust the pads by using a small screwdriver to loosen or tighten the screws. 

<h2>Adjust the Earpieces</h2>

The next step to fixing Oakley arms is to adjust the earpieces. If the earpieces are too tight, it can cause the arms to not fit properly. To adjust the earpieces, you will need to unscrew the screws on the sides of the frame and then slide the earpieces in or out until they fit properly. Once you have adjusted the earpieces, be sure to tighten the screws back up. 

<h2>Check the Hinges</h2>

The next step to fixing Oakley arms is to check the hinges. If the hinges are not working properly, it can cause the arms to not fit properly. To check the hinges, take a look at them from the side and see if they are moving freely or if they are stuck. If they are stuck, you can use a small screwdriver to loosen up the screws and then adjust the hinges until they move freely. 

<h2>Check the Screws</h2>

The last step to fixing Oakley arms is to check the screws. If the screws are loose or missing, it can cause the arms to not fit properly. To check the screws, take a look at them from the side and see if they are secure or if they are loose. If they are loose, you can use a small screwdriver to tighten them back up.
