<p>Wicker furniture is beautiful and can be used in a variety of settings, both indoors and outdoors. Unfortunately, wicker furniture can be quite fragile and can easily break if it is not properly cared for. One of the most common problems with wicker furniture is a broken chair leg. If you have a broken wicker chair leg, there is no need to replace the entire piece. With a few simple tools and supplies, you can easily repair the broken leg and have your wicker chair looking like new again!</p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you begin the repair process, you will need the following supplies:</p>

<ul>
<li>A drill</li>
<li>Wood glue</li>
<li>Wood screws</li>
<li>Sandpaper</li>
<li>Paint</li>
<li>Varnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Remove the Broken Piece</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a broken wicker chair leg is to remove the broken piece. This can be done by simply unscrewing the screws that hold the piece in place. Once the screws are removed, the broken piece should come off easily. If necessary, use a hammer to gently tap the broken piece away from the chair.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Prepare the Surface for Glue</h2>

<p>Once the broken piece has been removed, the surface of the chair leg must be prepared for the application of glue. Begin by sanding the area around the break to remove any splinters or rough edges. This will ensure that the glue will adhere properly to the surface. Once the area is sanded, wipe down the surface with a damp cloth to remove any dust or debris.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Glue the Broken Pieces Together</h2>

<p>Once the surface is prepared, it is time to glue the broken pieces back together. Apply a generous amount of wood glue to the broken edges, making sure to get an even coverage. Once the glue is applied, press the broken pieces back together firmly, making sure that the edges line up perfectly. Allow the glue to dry for several hours or overnight.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Drill Pilot Holes and Insert Screws</h2>

<p>Once the glue has dried, you will need to drill two pilot holes in the leg and insert two wood screws. This will help to reinforce the bond of the glue and ensure that the leg does not come apart. Make sure to use screws that are the same size as the original screws that were used to hold the piece together.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Sand, Paint, and Varnish</h2>

<p>The final step in the repair process is to sand, paint, and varnish the leg. Begin by sanding the area around the break to remove any rough edges or splinters. Next, apply a coat of paint to the area to make it match the color of the rest of the chair. Finally, apply a coat of varnish to the area to protect it from moisture and wear.</p>
