<p>Bleeding mountain bike brakes without a kit is a relatively simple process that can be completed in a few basic steps. While a kit is not necessary for this task, having one on hand can make the process easier and quicker. In this article, we’ll discuss how to bleed mountain bike brakes without a kit, the tools you’ll need, and the steps you’ll have to follow.</p>

<h2>Tools You'll Need</h2>

<p>The tools you’ll need to bleed your mountain bike brakes without a kit are relatively simple. You’ll need a flathead screwdriver, a flat-tipped needle nose pliers, a wrench, a container to hold the old brake fluid, and a new bottle of brake fluid.</p>

<h2>Steps to Bleed Mountain Bike Brakes Without a Kit</h2>

<p>The first step in bleeding your mountain bike brakes without a kit is to locate the brake caliper. This is usually located near the bottom of your bike frame, near the rear wheel. Once you’ve located the brake caliper, you’ll need to remove the caliper bolts using a wrench. Once the bolts have been removed, you can then remove the caliper from the frame.</p>

<p>The next step is to locate the bleed valve on the brake caliper. This is usually located near the top of the caliper. Once you’ve located the valve, you’ll need to use a flathead screwdriver to loosen it. Once it has been loosened, you can then use a flat-tipped needle nose pliers to remove the valve completely.</p>

<p>The next step is to place a container beneath the caliper to catch the old brake fluid as it drains out. Once the container is in place, you can then slowly open the bleed valve using the flathead screwdriver. As you open the valve, the old brake fluid should start to flow out. Once the flow stops, you can then close the valve.</p>

<p>The next step is to fill the brake caliper with new brake fluid. To do this, you’ll need to open the top of the caliper and pour in new brake fluid. Once the caliper is full, you can then close the top and replace the bleed valve.</p>

<p>The final step is to replace the caliper bolts and tighten them using a wrench. Once the bolts are tight, you can then check that the brakes are working correctly by pressing down on the brake lever.</p>
