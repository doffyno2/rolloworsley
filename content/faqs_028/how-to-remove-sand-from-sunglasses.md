Having sand in your sunglasses can be a real nuisance. It can cause your vision to be off, or it can even scratch the lenses. Fortunately, there are several ways to remove sand from your sunglasses without damaging them. In this article, we will discuss how to remove sand from sunglasses and how to prevent it in the future.

<h2>What Causes Sand to Get in Your Sunglasses?</h2>

There are several ways that sand can get in your sunglasses. The most common way is through wind. If you are near a beach, the wind can easily pick up sand particles and deposit them in your sunglasses. Other common ways that sand can get into your sunglasses are from rubbing your eyes or from handling the lenses with dirty hands.

<h2>How to Remove Sand from Your Sunglasses</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Rinse with Water</h3>

The first step in removing sand from your sunglasses is to rinse them with water. If you are near a body of water, you can rinse them in the water. If not, then you can use a sink or a bucket of water. Once you have rinsed the lenses, use your fingers to rub the lenses in a circular motion. This will help to loosen the sand and other debris from the lenses.

<h3>Step 2: Use a Soft Brush</h3>

The next step is to use a soft brush to remove the sand from the lenses. A soft toothbrush or an old makeup brush works best. Gently brush the lenses in a circular motion to remove the sand. Be careful not to press too hard and scratch the lenses.

<h3>Step 3: Use a Clean Cloth</h3>

Once you have removed the sand from the lenses, use a clean cloth to dry the lenses. A microfiber cloth works best. Gently wipe the lenses with the cloth and make sure to get rid of any remaining sand or debris.

<h3>Step 4: Use a Lens Cleaner</h3>

You can also use a lens cleaner to remove any remaining residue from the lenses. Choose a lens cleaner specifically designed for sunglasses and follow the instructions on the bottle. This will help to ensure that your lenses are free of any debris or residue.

<h2>How to Prevent Sand From Getting Into Your Sunglasses</h2>

Now that you know how to remove sand from your sunglasses, it is important to know how to prevent it from getting in in the first place. Here are some tips for preventing sand from getting into your sunglasses:

<h3>Keep Your Sunglasses Covered</h3>

When you are not wearing your sunglasses, make sure to keep them covered. This will help to protect them from the wind, which can easily pick up sand particles and deposit them in your lenses. A sunglass case or a microfiber cloth is a great way to keep your sunglasses covered when not in use.
