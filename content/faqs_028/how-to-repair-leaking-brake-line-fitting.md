<p>Having a brake line fitting that is leaking can be a serious issue for your vehicle. Not only can it lead to brake failure and an accident, but it can also cause damage to other parts of the vehicle. A leaking brake line fitting should be repaired as soon as possible for the safety of the driver and passengers. Here is an overview of how to repair a leaking brake line fitting.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing the Leak</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a leaking brake line fitting is to diagnose the leak. This can be done by examining the area around the brake line fitting. If there is a crack or hole in the brake line, it can easily be seen. If the leak is more subtle, it may require the use of a pressure tester to determine where the leak is occurring. Once the leak is identified, the repair process can begin.</p>

<h2>Removing the Fitting</h2>

<p>Once the leak is identified, the next step is to remove the fitting from the brake line. This is done by disconnecting the brake line from the fitting. Depending on the type of fitting, this may require the use of an open-end wrench or an adjustable wrench. It is important to be careful when removing the fitting, as it can be difficult to reattach it once it has been removed.</p>

<h2>Cleaning the Fitting</h2>

<p>Once the fitting has been removed, it should be cleaned thoroughly. This is done to remove any debris or buildup that may have accumulated on the fitting. This can be done using a wire brush or a piece of cloth to wipe away any debris. Once the fitting has been cleaned, it should be inspected for any damage that may have occurred during the removal process.</p>

<h2>Replacing the Fitting</h2>

<p>Once the fitting has been cleaned and inspected, it should be replaced with a new one. This can be done by attaching the new fitting to the brake line and securing it with a nut and bolt. It is important to make sure that the fitting is properly secured, as this will ensure that the leak does not occur again. Once the fitting is in place, it should be tested to make sure it is not leaking.</p>

<h2>Testing the Fitting</h2>

<p>Once the fitting has been replaced, it should be tested to make sure that it is not leaking. This can be done by using a pressure tester to check for any leaks. If the pressure tester shows that the fitting is not leaking, then the repair has been completed successfully.</p>
