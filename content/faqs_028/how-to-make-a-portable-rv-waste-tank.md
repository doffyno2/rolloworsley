<h2>What Is A Portable RV Waste Tank?</h2>

A portable RV waste tank is a container that is used to store and transport wastewater from your recreational vehicle (RV). It is typically made from plastic, rubber or steel and can be used to store greywater and blackwater from the RV’s onboard tanks. The tank sits on the ground and is connected to the RV’s onboard tanks via a hose. It is an essential item for anyone who wants to take their RV on extended trips, as it allows them to take their waste with them rather than having to dump it at a designated dump station.

This makes it ideal for campers and RVers who want to go on long trips without worrying about having to find a dump station. It is also a great way to keep your RV’s onboard tanks from becoming too full, as they can only hold a limited amount of wastewater.
