Traveling can be stressful and hectic enough without having to worry about wrinkled clothes.

Fortunately, there are a few simple techniques that you can use to fold your polo shirts quickly and easily and keep them looking fresh and crisp when you unpack.

<h2>Step by Step Guide to Folding a Polo Shirt for Travel</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Lay Out the Shirt on a Flat Surface</h3>

The first step in folding a polo shirt is to lay it out on a flat surface. Make sure that the shirt is completely unfolded and that all the buttons are fastened. If the shirt is particularly wrinkled, you may want to steam or iron the shirt first.

<h3>Step 2: Smooth Out the Shirt</h3>

Once the shirt is laid out, you will want to smooth out any wrinkles or creases. This can be done by running your hands over the fabric in a gentle, even motion. You may also want to use a steamer or iron to further smooth out the fabric.

<h3>Step 3: Fold the Sleeves Underneath</h3>

Once the shirt is smooth, you will want to fold the sleeves underneath. Start by folding each sleeve in half lengthwise, then fold each sleeve in half again. Make sure that the sleeves are tucked neatly under the body of the shirt.

<h3>Step 4: Fold the Shirt in Half</h3>

Once the sleeves are tucked in, you will want to fold the shirt in half. Start by folding the bottom of the shirt up to meet the collar. Then, fold the shirt in half again, bringing the two sides together.

<h3>Step 5: Roll the Shirt</h3>

Once the shirt is folded in half, you will want to roll it up. Start at the bottom and roll the shirt up towards the collar. Make sure to keep the shirt tightly rolled, as this will help prevent wrinkles and creases.

Once the shirt is neatly rolled up, you can place it in your luggage. Make sure that the shirt is placed in an area that will not be crushed or folded. You may also want to place a towel or other protective material around the shirt to help keep it from becoming wrinkled.
