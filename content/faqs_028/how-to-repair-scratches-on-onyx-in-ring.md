Onyx jewelry can be a great addition to any wardrobe. The dark, glossy stones make for sophisticated and elegant pieces. Unfortunately, onyx is also a very fragile stone, making it prone to scratches, chips, and other forms of damage. If your onyx ring has scratches, don’t worry – it is possible to repair them. 

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

Before you begin to repair your onyx ring, you will need to gather the following supplies:

<ul>
  <li>Soft cloth</li>
  <li>Jeweler’s polishing cloth</li>
  <li>Jeweler’s polishing compound</li>
  <li>Jeweler’s rouge</li>
  <li>Jeweler’s buffing wheel</li>
  <li>Jeweler’s magnifying glass</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Onyx</h2>

The first step in repairing your onyx ring is to clean it. Take a soft, lint-free cloth and gently wipe away any dirt or debris. Be sure to take your time and be very gentle. 

<h2>Step 2: Polish the Onyx</h2>

Once the onyx is clean, it’s time to polish it. Take a jeweler’s polishing cloth and apply a light pressure while rubbing the onyx in a circular motion. This will help to bring out the natural luster of the stone. 

<h2>Step 3: Apply the Polishing Compound</h2>

Next, take a jeweler’s polishing compound and apply it to the onyx. Again, use a light pressure and rub the compound in a circular motion. This will help to remove any remaining dirt or debris and will also help to fill in any small scratches. 

<h2>Step 4: Buff the Onyx</h2>

Once the polishing compound has been applied, it’s time to buff the onyx. Take a jeweler’s buffing wheel and attach it to a hand drill. Set the speed to low and begin buffing the onyx in a circular motion. This will help to further polish the stone and will help to remove any remaining scratches. 

<h2>Step 5: Apply the Jeweler’s Rouge</h2>

Now it’s time to apply the jeweler’s rouge. Take a small amount of the rouge and apply it to the onyx. Then, using a soft cloth, gently buff the stone until it shines. This will help to further polish the stone and will bring out its natural luster. 

<h2>Step 6: Inspect the Onyx</h2>

Once you have finished buffing the onyx, it’s time to inspect it. Take a jeweler’s magnifying glass and closely inspect the stone. Look for any remaining scratches or chips that may need to be repaired. 

<h2>Step 7: Repeat if Necessary</h2>

If you do find any scratches or chips that need to be repaired, simply repeat the steps outlined above. Once you have finished, your onyx ring should be as good as new.
