<h2>What are Feed Dogs?</h2>

Feed dogs, or feed dog teeth, are part of a sewing machine that help guide the fabric through the machine as you sew. They are usually made of metal and have small, pointed teeth or ridges that extend from the throat plate and into the needle plate. The feed dogs move up and down as the needle moves up and down, helping to move the fabric along as it is being sewn.

<h2>Why Should You Change Your Feed Dogs?</h2>

It is important to change your feed dogs regularly because they can become worn over time. If they become too worn, they won’t be able to grip and move the fabric, resulting in uneven stitches or skipped stitches. If you find that your feed dogs are not gripping your fabric or are skipping stitches, it is probably time to change them.

<h2> How to Change Feed Dogs on a Singer Sewing Machine</h2>

Changing the feed dogs on a Singer sewing machine is a relatively simple process. Here’s what you need to do:

<h3>Step 1: Unplug the Sewing Machine</h3>

Before you start, make sure to unplug your sewing machine from the wall. This is an important safety measure and should always be done before starting any sewing machine maintenance.

<h3>Step 2: Remove the Presser Foot and Needle Plate</h3>

Next, you will need to remove the presser foot and needle plate. To do this, loosen the thumb screw on the presser foot and then lift up the presser foot so that it is level with the needle plate. Then, carefully remove the needle plate by lifting up and out.

<h3>Step 3: Remove the Feed Dogs</h3>

Now that the presser foot and needle plate are out of the way, you can see the feed dogs. Carefully remove the feed dogs by unscrewing them from the throat plate. Depending on your machine, you may need to use a pair of pliers to loosen the screws.

<h3>Step 4: Install the New Feed Dogs</h3>

Once the old feed dogs are removed, you can install the new ones. Make sure they are lined up correctly with the slots on the throat plate and then secure them with the screws. Make sure the screws are tight, but not too tight, to avoid damaging the feed dogs.

<h3>Step 5: Re-Install the Needle Plate and Presser Foot</h3>

Once the new feed dogs are in place, you can re-install the needle plate and presser foot. Make sure they are securely in place and then tighten the thumb screw on the presser foot.

<h3>Step 6: Test the Sewing Machine</h3>

Once everything is back in place, it’s time to test the sewing machine. Plug it in and use it to sew a few stitches on scrap fabric to make sure the feed dogs are working correctly.
