<p>GPS Exchange Format (GPX) is a file format designed for storing geographic data. It is the most popular file format for exchanging GPS data between different applications and devices, and it is supported by a wide range of GPS receivers, mapping programs, and web services. GPX files contain waypoints, routes, and tracks, which can be used to store and share GPS data with others.</p>

<p>In this article, we will explain how to open GPX files and how to view the data they contain. We will also provide some tips on how to create and edit GPX files, as well as how to convert GPX files to other formats.</p>

<h2>What is a GPX File?</h2>

<p>A GPX file is a GPS Exchange Format file, which is used to store geographical data. It is one of the most widely used formats for exchanging GPS data between different applications and devices. GPX files contain waypoints, routes, and tracks, which can be used to store and share GPS data with others.</p>

<h2>How to Open GPX Files</h2>

<p>You can open a GPX file with any text editor, such as Notepad++ or TextEdit. The file will contain a series of XML tags, which contain the GPS data. You can view the data, but it won't be very useful unless you understand the XML tags.</p>

<p>To view the data in a more useful format, you can use a GPX viewer. There are many free viewers available, such as GPX Viewer and GPS Visualizer. These viewers allow you to view the GPS data in a more user-friendly format, and they can also be used to create and edit GPX files.</p>

<h2>How to Convert GPX Files</h2>

<p>GPX files can be converted to other formats, such as KML (Keyhole Markup Language) and CSV (Comma Separated Values). You can use a file conversion program, such as FileZigZag, to convert GPX files to other formats. You can also use a GPX viewer to export the data to other formats.</p>

<h2>How to Create GPX Files</h2>

<p>You can create GPX files using a GPS device or a GPS mapping program. Most GPS devices and mapping programs allow you to save your data in GPX format. You can also use a GPX viewer to create GPX files from scratch. You can enter the GPS coordinates and other data manually, or you can import data from other sources.</p>

<h2>How to Edit GPX Files</h2>

<p>You can use a GPX viewer to edit existing GPX files. Most GPX viewers allow you to add, delete, and edit waypoints, tracks, and routes. You can also use the viewer to change the coordinates of existing waypoints and tracks, or to add new data to the file.</p>
