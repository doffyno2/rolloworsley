Making your own moonshine still is surprisingly easy, and it can be done with items you already have on hand. This guide will walk you through the basics of how to make a stove top moonshine still.

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

Before you start, you'll need to make sure you have the essential items. Here's what you'll need:

<ul>
  <li>A heat source, such as a stove or hot plate</li>
  <li>A pot or other container</li>
  <li>A lid for the pot</li>
  <li>A condensing pipe</li>
  <li>A collection vessel</li>
  <li>A thermometer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Making the Stove Top Moonshine Still</h2>

Once you have all the necessary items, it's time to start building the still. Here's how to do it:

<h3>Step 1: Place the Pot</h3>

Start by placing the pot on the heat source. Make sure it's secure and won't tip over.

<h3>Step 2: Attach the Condensing Pipe</h3>

Attach the condensing pipe to the lid of the pot. This pipe will collect the vapors that come off the pot and allow them to cool and condense back into liquid.

<h3>Step 3: Attach the Collection Vessel</h3>

Attach the collection vessel to the end of the condensing pipe. This is where the condensed liquid will collect.

<h3>Step 4: Heat the Pot</h3>

Turn on the heat source and start heating the pot. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature. The ideal temperature for a stove top still is between 170 and 190 degrees Fahrenheit.

<h3>Step 5: Collect the Liquid</h3>

Once the liquid has been collected in the collection vessel, it can be used for whatever purpose you have in mind. 

<h2>Tips for Making a Stove Top Moonshine Still</h2>
