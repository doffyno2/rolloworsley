<p>Croakies are a great way to protect your sunglasses from falling off your face. Not only do they keep your sunglasses securely in place, but they also add a fashionable touch to your look. Croakies come in a variety of colors and styles, so you can find one that matches your sunglasses and your style. Here’s how to put Croakies on your sunglasses.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Choose Your Croakies</h2>

<p>The first step in putting on Croakies is to choose the ones that you want to use. Croakies come in a variety of colors and styles, so you can choose one that matches your sunglasses and your style. For example, if you have a more sporty style, then you may want to go with a black or grey Croakie. If you have a more retro style, then you may want to go with a fun patterned or colored Croakie. Once you’ve chosen your Croakie, you’re ready to move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Attach the Croakies to Your Sunglasses</h2>

<p>Once you’ve chosen your Croakies, you can begin attaching them to your sunglasses. To do this, you’ll need to loosen the screws on each side of your sunglasses. Next, place the Croakie onto the screws, making sure that the ends are lined up with the ends of the screws. When the ends are lined up, tighten the screws to secure the Croakie in place.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Length of the Croakie</h2>

<p>Once the Croakie is attached to your sunglasses, you can adjust the length to fit your face. To do this, simply pull on each end of the Croakie until it is the desired length. If the Croakie is too long, you can use a pair of scissors to trim it down to size. Once the Croakie is the desired length, you’re ready to go.</p>
