How to Get Musty Smell Out of Suitcase

Traveling can be a very enjoyable experience, but it can also be a source of stress, especially when it comes to packing. One of the most common problems you might face when packing is dealing with musty odors in your suitcase. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to get rid of that musty smell and make your suitcase smell fresh again.



Musty smells in suitcases are caused by a combination of moisture and bacteria. This is especially common in suitcases that are stored in damp, dark areas such as closets or basements. The moisture in these areas can be absorbed by the suitcase and create a breeding ground for bacteria, which can then produce a musty smell.



Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to get rid of the musty smell in your suitcase and make it smell fresh again.

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Inside of the Suitcase</h2>

The first step is to clean the inside of the suitcase. Remove all of the items from the suitcase and vacuum the entire interior. Be sure to get into all of the nooks and crannies. This will help to remove any dirt and debris that may be contributing to the musty smell.

<h2>Step 2: Clean the Outside of the Suitcase</h2>

Next, you'll want to clean the outside of the suitcase. Use a damp cloth to remove any dirt or debris that may be contributing to the musty smell. If the suitcase is made of leather, use a leather cleaner to clean the exterior.

<h2>Step 3: Deodorize the Suitcase</h2>

After the suitcase is clean, you'll want to deodorize it. There are a few different methods you can use. One option is to sprinkle baking soda inside the suitcase and leave it for several hours. The baking soda will absorb any odors and leave the suitcase smelling fresh.

Another option is to use a fabric refresher spray. This type of spray will help to neutralize any odors and leave your suitcase smelling fresh. Be sure to use a natural, non-toxic spray that won't damage the fabric of your suitcase.

<h2>Step 4: Store the Suitcase Properly</h2>

The final step is to store the suitcase properly. Be sure to store it in a dry, well-ventilated area such as a closet or chest of drawers. This will help to prevent moisture and bacteria from building up and causing a musty smell.
