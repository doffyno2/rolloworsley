<p>Chain link fences are often used to contain dogs and other pets in the yard. However, these fences can be too short to keep some breeds of dogs from jumping over them. If you have a dog that is an escape artist, you may need to make your chain link fence taller. Here are some tips for making your chain link fence taller for dogs. </p>

<h2>Choose the Right Height of Fence</h2>

<p>The first step to making your chain link fence taller for dogs is to choose the right height for the fence. You should choose a fence height that is at least four feet high. This height should be enough to keep most breeds of dogs from jumping over it. If you have a larger breed of dog, you may need to go with a higher fence. </p>

<h2>Install Additional Fencing</h2>

<p>If the fence height is not enough to keep your dog contained, you can install additional fencing on top of the existing chain link fence. This will add height and make it more difficult for your dog to jump over the fence. You can use a variety of fencing materials, such as welded wire, vinyl, or wood. </p>

<h2>Add a Topper to the Fence</h2>

<p>Another option for making your chain link fence taller for dogs is to add a topper to the existing fence. This is a piece of fencing material that is installed on top of the chain link fence.

The rolled wire fence will add height and make it more difficult for your dog to jump over the fence. </p>

<h2>Install an Extension Kit</h2>
