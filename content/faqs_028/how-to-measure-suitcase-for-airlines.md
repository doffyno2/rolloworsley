Traveling by air can be a stressful experience, especially if you are unsure about the size and weight of your suitcase. Airlines have different size and weight restrictions for each type of luggage, which can make it difficult to know if your suitcase is suitable for the flight. This article will explain how to measure a suitcase for airlines to ensure that it meets the airline’s requirements.

<h2>What Size Is a Carry-On Bag?</h2>

A carry-on bag is a suitcase, bag, or container that is small enough to fit in an overhead bin on an airplane. Carry-on bags typically measure between 45 and 56 centimeters in length, and must weigh no more than 7 kilograms. Depending on the airline, they may also be subject to additional restrictions, such as a maximum width of 23 centimeters, or a maximum height of 38 centimeters.

<h2>What Size Is a Checked Bag?</h2>

A checked bag is a suitcase, bag, or container that is too large to fit in an overhead bin and must be checked in at the airport. The size and weight of checked bags can vary depending on the airline, but typically they measure between 61 and 81 centimeters in length and weigh no more than 23 kilograms. Again, depending on the airline, checked bags may also be subject to additional restrictions, such as a maximum width of 45 centimeters, or a maximum height of 63 centimeters.

<h2>How to Measure a Suitcase for Airlines</h2>

The best way to measure a suitcase for airlines is to use a tape measure. Start by measuring the length of the suitcase from the wheels to the handles. Then, measure the width of the suitcase from side to side, and the height of the suitcase from the bottom to the top. Finally, weigh the suitcase on a scale to determine its weight. Once you have all of the measurements, you can compare them to the airline’s restrictions to determine if the suitcase is suitable for the flight.

<h2>Tips for Measuring a Suitcase</h2>

When measuring a suitcase, it is important to take into account any features that may affect the size or weight of the suitcase. For example, some suitcases have expandable compartments or pockets that can increase the overall size or weight of the suitcase. Additionally, some suitcases have handles or locks that can add extra weight. It is important to take these features into account when measuring a suitcase for airlines.

<h2>What to Do If the Suitcase Is Too Big or Too Heavy</h2>

If the suitcase is too big or too heavy for the airline’s restrictions, it is important to take steps to reduce its size or weight. For example, you can remove items from the suitcase to reduce its weight, or rearrange the items inside the suitcase to reduce its size. Additionally, you can purchase a smaller or lighter suitcase to use for your flight.
