<p>Spurs are an important part of a rider's equipment, and when used correctly can be a powerful tool in the communication between horse and rider. In English riding, spurs are an important part of the bridle, and are used to encourage the horse to respond to the rider's aids. Here is an overview of how to correctly put spurs on English riding boots and the different types of spurs available.</p>

<h2>Types of Spurs</h2>

<p>There are two main types of spurs used in English riding: rowel spurs and blunt spurs. Rowel spurs have a rotating wheel on the end of the spur, which can be used to provide a gentle reminder to the horse. Blunt spurs are more commonly used in dressage, and have a flat end for a more subtle contact with the horse.</p>

<h2>Putting on Spurs</h2>

<p>When putting on spurs, it is important to ensure that they are securely attached to the boots. Start by making sure that the spur straps are the correct length for your boots. The straps should be tight enough to keep the spurs from slipping, but not so tight that they are uncomfortable. Next, thread the straps through the spur and buckle them securely. Make sure that the buckle is facing away from your foot, so that it will not rub or chafe.</p>

<h2>Positioning Spurs</h2>

<p>Once the spurs are securely attached to the boots, it is important to adjust their position correctly. The spurs should be positioned just behind the bend of the ankle, on either side of the foot. Make sure that the spurs are lined up with the horse's flank, so that they will not get in the way of the stirrups. It is also important to make sure that the spurs are not too close to the horse, as this can cause discomfort.</p>

<h2>Using Spurs</h2>

<p>Once your spurs are securely attached and correctly positioned, you can start using them. When using spurs, it is important to be gentle and use a light touch. Start by lightly tapping the horse's side with the spur, and gradually increasing the pressure if necessary. It is important to be aware of the horse's reactions, and to stop spurring immediately if the horse becomes uncomfortable or unresponsive. Do not use excessive force, as this can cause pain and distress to the horse.</p>

<h2>Care and Maintenance</h2>

<p>Spurs should be cleaned and inspected regularly to ensure that they are in good condition. Check the straps for any signs of wear or damage, and make sure that the buckle is securely fastened. Clean the spurs with a damp cloth and mild soap, and dry thoroughly before storing. It is also important to inspect the spurs for any signs of rust or corrosion, and to replace them if necessary.</p>
