<p><b>Baseboard</b> is a term used to describe the trim that is installed around the base of a wall. It is usually made of wood, but can also be made of other materials such as metal or vinyl. It provides a finished look to a room and also helps to protect the walls from damage. However, over time, baseboard can become cracked or warped due to wear and tear, or due to the effects of moisture. In this article, we will discuss how to repair cracks in baseboard.</p>

<h2>Steps to Repair Cracks in Baseboard</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Using the sandpaper, sand down the area around the crack to make sure the surface is smooth.</li>
