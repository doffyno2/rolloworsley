<p>Do you want to increase the security of your iPhone? Are you looking for an easier way to protect your device and data? One of the best ways to do so is to change the password of your iPhone to 4 digits. This article will help you understand the steps involved in setting up a 4-digit password on your iPhone.</p>

<h2>What Is a 4-Digit Password?</h2>

<p>A 4-digit password is a type of passcode created with four numbers. It is one of the most common types of passwords used for securing devices and data, as it is easy to remember and difficult to crack. When setting up a passcode for your iPhone, you can choose either a 4-digit or 6-digit password. The 6-digit password is more secure, but the 4-digit password is still a great way to protect your device from unwanted access.</p>
