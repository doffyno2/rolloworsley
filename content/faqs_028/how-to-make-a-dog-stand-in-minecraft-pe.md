<p>Minecraft PE is the incredibly popular mobile version of the popular building game, Minecraft. It’s a game where you can create amazing structures and environments, and it’s loads of fun for players of all ages. One of the most creative things you can do in the game is to make a dog stand. This can be done in a few simple steps and can add a lot of fun and personality to your Minecraft PE world.</p>

<h2>What You Need</h2>

<p>To make a dog stand in Minecraft PE, you’ll need the following items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A single piece of gravel</li>
  <li>A single piece of dirt</li>
  <li>A single piece of cobblestone</li>
  <li>A single piece of coal</li>
  <li>A single piece of oak wood</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Place the Materials</h2>

<p>The first step to making a dog stand in Minecraft PE is to place the materials. Put the gravel on the ground, the dirt on top of the gravel, the cobblestone on top of the dirt, the coal on top of the cobblestone, and the oak wood on top of the coal. Make sure all of the pieces are touching each other.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Craft the Dog Stand</h2>

<p>Once you’ve placed the materials, you can craft the dog stand. To do this, right-click on the oak wood and select “Craft Dog Stand.” This will create a dog stand in the middle of the materials. The dog stand will look like a small wooden platform, with a small hole in the center for the dog to stand in.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Place a Dog on the Stand</h2>

<p>The last step is to place a dog on the stand. To do this, right-click on the dog stand and select “Place Dog.” This will spawn a dog on the stand. The dog will remain standing until you remove it.</p>
