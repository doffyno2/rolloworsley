# How to Keep Gnats Off My Dog and Myself

Gnats are small, pesky insects that can be a nuisance both indoors and outdoors, but luckily there are ways to keep them away from you and your canine companion. In this article, we’ll discuss the best methods to keep gnats away from you and your pet, as well as how to prevent them from coming back.

## What are Gnats?

Gnats are small, annoying insects that can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments. They come in a variety of sizes and colors, but most are black or dark brown. Gnats are most active during the daytime and are attracted to light, so they often swarm around windows and lights. They’re not dangerous, but they can be quite annoying.

## What Attracts Gnats to Dogs?

Gnats are attracted to the warm, moist environment that dogs provide, and they’re especially drawn to the smell of sweat, saliva, and other odors that a dog exudes. Dogs that have allergies, skin conditions, or other health issues are more likely to attract gnats than healthy dogs.

## How to Keep Gnats Away From Dogs

### Bathe Frequently

One of the best ways to keep gnats away from your dog is to bathe them regularly. Gnats are attracted to the odors and sweat that can build up on a dog’s fur, so regular baths can help to keep them away. Make sure to use a mild shampoo and rinse your dog thoroughly after the bath to help keep gnats away.

### Use Natural Repellents

There are a variety of natural repellents that can help to keep gnats away from your dog. Citronella oil, eucalyptus oil, and lavender oil are all good options. You can either purchase these oils in concentrated form and mix them with water, or you can buy pre-mixed repellents that are specifically designed for dogs.

### Use Fans

Gnats are attracted to light and heat, so setting up a few fans around your home or yard can help to keep them away. The fans will create a breeze that will keep gnats at bay.

### Use Insecticides

If natural repellents and fans aren’t enough to keep the gnats away, you can also use commercial insecticides. Be sure to choose one that is specifically designed for use on dogs, and follow the instructions carefully.

## How to Keep Gnats Away From Yourself

### Wear Light Colored Clothing

Gnats are attracted to dark colors, so wearing light colored clothing can help to keep them away. Stick to light colors like white, tan, or light blue.

### Wear Insect Repellent

Insect repellents can also be used to keep gnats away from your skin. Choose a repellent that contains DEET or picaridin, both of which are effective at keeping gnats away.

### Avoid Strong Scents

Gnats are attracted to strong scents, so it’s best to avoid wearing perfumes or lotions that have a strong scent. If you must wear a scent, choose one that has a light, clean smell.

### Keep Windows and Doors Closed

Gnats are attracted to light, so keeping your windows and doors closed can help to keep them away. This is especially important at night, when gnats are most active.
