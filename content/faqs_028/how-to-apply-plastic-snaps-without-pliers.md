<p>Applying plastic snaps without using pliers is a great way to save time and money, while still getting the same professional look that pliers give. Plastic snaps are a great way to add a fun and decorative touch to any fabric or clothing item, and they can be applied without the need for pliers. This article will provide a step by step guide on how to apply plastic snaps without pliers.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>To apply plastic snaps without pliers, you'll need the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plastic snaps</li>
  <li>Snap fastener tool</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
  <li>Fabric</li>
  <li>Pen or marker</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Mark the Fabric</h2>

<p>The first step is to mark the fabric where the snap will be placed. Use a pen or marker to draw a small dot on the fabric where the snap will be placed. Make sure the dot is visible and easy to see.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Insert the Snap Fastener Tool</h2>

<p>The next step is to insert the snap fastener tool into the plastic snap. Make sure the tool is securely inserted into the snap so that it does not slip out when applying the snap. Once the tool is in place, press the tool firmly against the fabric where the dot was marked.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply the Snap Fastener Tool</h2>

<p>Now it's time to apply the snap fastener tool to the fabric. Start by pressing the tool firmly against the fabric, making sure it is securely attached. Once the tool is in place, press down on the handle of the tool to press the snap firmly into the fabric.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Remove the Snap Fastener Tool</h2>

<p>Once the snap is securely attached to the fabric, it's time to remove the snap fastener tool. Carefully pull the tool away from the fabric, being careful not to damage the fabric or the snap. Once the tool is removed, the snap should be firmly attached to the fabric.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Cut the Excess Fabric</h2>

Use a pair of scissors to carefully cut away any excess fabric that is not necessary for attaching the snap. Be sure to cut away any excess fabric from around the snap, as this will help prevent the snap from coming loose.</p>
