<p>Ironing a non-iron shirt requires a different technique than regular ironing. Non-iron shirts are made from fabrics that are treated with a special chemical coating that prevents them from wrinkling. This makes them easier to care for, but if you want to keep your non-iron shirt looking its best, you need to know the proper way to iron it. The following steps will help you get the job done right.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Turn the Shirt Inside Out</h2>
<p>Before you begin to iron your non-iron shirt, you should turn it inside out. This will help protect the chemical coating on the shirt and prevent it from becoming damaged by the heat of the iron. It will also help prevent any stains or discoloration from the iron.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Set the Iron to a Low Temperature</h2>
<p>The next step is to set the temperature of your iron to a low setting. This is important because non-iron shirts are made from delicate fabrics that can be easily damaged by high temperatures. You should also use a steam setting, as this will help to make the fabric more malleable and easier to iron.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Iron the Shirt</h2>
<p>Once you have set the iron to an appropriate temperature and the shirt is turned inside out, you can begin to iron. Start by ironing the back of the shirt first, then move on to the sleeves. When you are ironing the sleeves, make sure to start at the shoulder and work your way down. Work in small sections, and press down firmly so that the fabric is smooth and wrinkle-free.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Turn the Shirt Right Side Out</h2>
<p>Once you have finished ironing the back and the sleeves of your non-iron shirt, you can turn it right side out and finish ironing the front. When ironing the front, pay special attention to the collar and cuffs as these are the most likely places for wrinkles to appear. Make sure to press down firmly, but be careful not to damage the fabric.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Hang the Shirt Up</h2>
<p>When you have finished ironing your non-iron shirt, hang it up to dry. This will help to keep the fabric from wrinkling and ensure that your shirt looks its best. It is also important to remember to hang it in a well-ventilated area, as this will help to prevent any moisture from damaging the fabric.</p>
