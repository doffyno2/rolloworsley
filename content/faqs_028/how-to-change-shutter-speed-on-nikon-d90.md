<h2>Introduction to Nikon D90</h2>

<p>The Nikon D90 is a digital single-lens reflex camera (DSLR) that was released in August 2008. It uses the Nikon F mount and is compatible with a wide range of Nikon lenses. The D90 is the first Nikon DSLR to feature video recording capabilities and has been widely praised for its excellent image quality, intuitive menu system, and robust construction. The D90 has been used by both amateur and professional photographers alike, making it a popular choice for those looking to upgrade their camera. </p>

<h2>Understanding Shutter Speed</h2>

<p>Shutter speed is one of the three main components of exposure in photography and is often referred to as a “stop”. It is simply the length of time that a camera’s shutter is open, allowing light to reach the sensor and capture the image. In general, faster shutter speeds (shorter exposure times) will freeze motion and create sharper images, while slower shutter speeds (longer exposure times) will blur motion and create softer images. It’s important to understand shutter speed and how it works when shooting with the Nikon D90. </p>

<h2>Changing the Shutter Speed on the Nikon D90</h2>

<p>The Nikon D90 has two main ways to change the shutter speed. The first is by using the camera’s “M” mode, which allows you to manually adjust the shutter speed. To do this, press the “Mode” button and then rotate the command dial to select “M” for Manual. You can then use the up and down arrows on the back of the camera to adjust the shutter speed. The second way to change the shutter speed is by using the “S” mode, which allows you to select a pre-set shutter speed. To do this, press the “Mode” button and then rotate the command dial to select “S” for Shutter Priority. You can then use the up and down arrows on the back of the camera to select the desired shutter speed. </p>

<h2>Tips for Changing Shutter Speed on the Nikon D90</h2>

<p>When using the Nikon D90, it’s important to understand how shutter speed affects your image. Faster shutter speeds are best for freezing motion, while slower shutter speeds are best for blurring motion. In addition, it’s important to remember that the faster the shutter speed, the more light is needed to properly expose the image. This can be compensated for by using a higher ISO setting or by using a wider aperture. It’s also important to note that the shutter speed can be changed in 1/3-stop increments by pressing the left or right arrow keys on the back of the camera. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

It’s important to understand how shutter speed works and how to change it in order to get the best results from your camera. The D90 has two main ways to change the shutter speed: using the “M” mode for manual adjustment, or using the “S” mode for pre-set shutter speeds.
