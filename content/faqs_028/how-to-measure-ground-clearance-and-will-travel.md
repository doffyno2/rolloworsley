How to Measure Ground Clearance and Will Travel


Ground clearance and will travel are two important measurements when it comes to selecting the right vehicle for your needs. Understanding these measurements and how to measure them are essential to making an informed decision when purchasing a car.

<h2>What is Ground Clearance?</h2>

Ground clearance is the measurement of the space between the bottom of the vehicle and the ground. This measurement is important because it determines how far you can drive over obstacles such as large potholes or rough terrain without damaging the undercarriage of the vehicle. Generally, the higher the ground clearance, the more capable the vehicle is of handling rough terrain.

<h2>What is Will Travel?</h2>

Will travel is the measurement of the total amount of vertical distance the car can travel. This measurement is important for vehicles that will be used for off-roading, as it determines how high the vehicle can safely climb or descend.

<h2>How to Measure Ground Clearance and Will Travel</h2>

Measuring ground clearance and will travel is relatively easy and can be done with a few basic tools.

<h3>Measuring Ground Clearance</h3>

The easiest way to measure ground clearance is with a tape measure. Begin by measuring the length of the vehicle from the front to the back. Then measure the distance between the ground and the lowest point of the vehicle. Subtract the length of the vehicle from the total distance to get the ground clearance.

<h3>Measuring Will Travel</h3>

Will travel can be measured in a similar manner. Begin by measuring the height of the vehicle from the ground to the highest point. Then measure the distance between the ground and the lowest point of the vehicle. Subtract the height of the vehicle from the total distance to get the will travel.

<h2>Why Measure Ground Clearance and Will Travel?</h2>

Measuring ground clearance and will travel is important for two main reasons. First, it can help you determine whether a particular vehicle is right for you. If you plan to take your vehicle off-roading, for example, a vehicle with higher ground clearance and will travel is usually preferable. Second, it can help you determine how much suspension work is required to make a vehicle suitable for off-roading.
