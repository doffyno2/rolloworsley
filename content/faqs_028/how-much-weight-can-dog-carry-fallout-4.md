How Much Weight Can Dogs Carry in Fallout 4?

Fallout 4 is an open-world, post-apocalyptic action role-playing video game, developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth major installment in the Fallout series and was released worldwide on November 10, 2015. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic Boston, Massachusetts, in the year 2287, 210 years after a devastating nuclear war. As the sole survivor of Vault 111, the player must explore the wasteland, complete quests, and build a life for themselves.

One of the most important aspects of Fallout 4 is managing the weight of your items. You have a limited amount of space to carry everything you need to survive, and you are also limited by your own physical strength. This is where dogs come in. Dogs are an important part of the game, and can be a great way to help you carry more items. But how much weight can they actually carry?

<h2>Dog Carrying Capacity in Fallout 4</h2>
In Fallout 4, dogs are able to carry a limited amount of weight. The amount of weight they can carry depends on their size. Smaller dogs, such as the Dogmeat variant, can carry up to 25 pounds while larger dogs, such as the German Shepherd, can carry up to 50 pounds. The amount of weight that can be carried by a dog is not affected by the player’s stats or skills, but rather is fixed depending on the dog’s size.

<h2>How to Make Your Dog Carry More Weight</h2>
There are a few ways that you can make your dog carry more weight in Fallout 4. The most obvious way is to pick a larger dog. As mentioned before, larger dogs can carry up to 50 pounds, while smaller dogs can only carry 25 pounds. Another way to increase the amount of weight your dog can carry is to equip it with armor. Dog armor provides additional protection for your dog and also increases the amount of weight it can carry. Finally, you can use chems to increase your dog’s carrying capacity. Chemicals such as Buffout and Psycho can be used to temporarily increase your dog’s carrying capacity.

<h2>Can You Ride a Dog in Fallout 4?</h2>
Unfortunately, you cannot ride a dog in Fallout 4. You can, however, use a dog to carry items for you. This can be especially useful if you are trying to transport large amounts of items across the wasteland.

<h2>How to Get a Dog in Fallout 4</h2>
There are a few ways to get a dog in Fallout 4. The most common way is to find one in the wasteland. Dogs can be found in various locations throughout the game. Another way to get a dog is to adopt one from the Diamond City Animal Shelter. This is a great way to get a loyal companion without having to search the wasteland.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Dogs are a great way to increase your carrying capacity in Fallout 4. They can carry up to 50 pounds and can be found in the wasteland or adopted from the Diamond City Animal Shelter. Unfortunately, you cannot ride a dog in Fallout 4, but you can use them to transport large amounts of items. So if you ever find yourself in need of extra carrying capacity, make sure to bring a dog along for the ride.
