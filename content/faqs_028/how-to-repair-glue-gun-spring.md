<p>A glue gun is a great way to quickly and easily attach two pieces of material together. They are great for a range of applications from crafting to home improvement projects. As with any tool, a glue gun will eventually need to be repaired. One of the most common problems with glue guns is a broken or worn-out spring. This guide will show you how to repair a glue gun spring and get your trusty tool back up and running.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>

<p>When repairing a glue gun spring, there are a few tools and materials that you will need. These include a Phillips head screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers, a replacement spring, and a small flathead screwdriver.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Remove the Glue Gun</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a glue gun spring is to remove the glue gun from its power source. This can typically be done by unplugging the power cord from the wall. After that, you will need to use a Phillips head screwdriver to unscrew the screws located on the back of the glue gun. This will allow you to remove the back cover of the glue gun and access the spring.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Spring</h2>

<p>Once the back cover of the glue gun has been removed, you will be able to access the spring. This is typically a small metal spring that is located in the back of the gun. You will need to use a pair of needle-nose pliers to carefully remove the spring. Be sure to pay attention to the orientation of the spring as you remove it, as it is important for the replacement spring to be installed in the same way.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Install the New Spring</h2>

<p>Once you have removed the old spring, you can install the new one. This can be done by using a small flathead screwdriver to carefully place the new spring in the same position as the old one. Be sure to pay attention to the orientation of the spring and make sure that it is installed correctly. Once the new spring is in place, you can use the needle-nose pliers to carefully adjust the tension of the spring.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Reassemble the Glue Gun</h2>

<p>Once you have installed the new spring, you can reassemble the glue gun. Start by replacing the back cover of the gun and using the Phillips head screwdriver to secure it in place. After that, you can plug the glue gun back into its power source and turn it on. The new spring should now be working correctly and you should be able to use the glue gun as normal.</p>
