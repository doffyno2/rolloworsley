<p>Derailleurs are the components of your bike that control the movement of the chain to the sprockets, allowing you to shift gears. This is especially important when riding on hills or in mountainous terrain, as having the right gear can make or break your ride. SRAM is a popular brand of derailleur, and adjusting your SRAM rear derailleur is the first step in making sure you have the right gear for the terrain you’re riding. </p>

<h2>What You Need to Adjust a SRAM Rear Derailleur</h2>

<p>Before you start adjusting your SRAM rear derailleur, you’ll need a few things. You’ll need a 4 mm Allen wrench, a 5 mm Allen wrench, a Phillips screwdriver, and a small flathead screwdriver. You’ll also need an adjustable wrench and a pair of pliers. </p>

<h2>Step 1: Inspect the Rear Derailleur </h2>

<p>Before you start making adjustments, you should inspect your SRAM rear derailleur to make sure it’s in good working condition. Look for any signs of wear or damage, and make sure the derailleur is properly aligned with the sprockets. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Cable Tension </h2>

<p>The cable tension is what controls the movement of the derailleur, so it’s important to get this right. Use the 4 mm Allen wrench to loosen the tension bolt on the rear derailleur. This will allow you to adjust the tension so that the derailleur moves smoothly. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjust the Limit Screws </h2>

<p>The limit screws are what keep the derailleur from overshifting or undershifting. To adjust them, you’ll need to loosen the 5 mm Allen bolt on the rear derailleur. Then, you can use the Phillips screwdriver to adjust the limit screws until they are set correctly. </p>

<h2>Step 4: Adjust the B-Screw </h2>

<p>The B-screw is what controls the distance between the derailleur and the sprockets. To adjust this, use the small flathead screwdriver to loosen the B-screw. Then, you can use the adjustable wrench to adjust the distance until it is correct. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Test the Derailleur </h2>

<p>Once you’ve finished adjusting your SRAM rear derailleur, you should test it to make sure it’s working properly. Start by shifting through the gears. If the derailleur is not shifting smoothly, then you may need to adjust the tension or limit screws. You should also check to make sure the derailleur is not overshifting or undershifting. If it is, then you may need to adjust the B-screw. </p>
