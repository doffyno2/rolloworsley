<h2>Introduction</h2>

The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) is a government agency that helps separated parents provide financial support for their children. It can be difficult for parents to agree on the amount of money that should be paid in child support, and the CMS is there to help mediate the situation. But, if you are a parent who is trying to avoid paying for your children’s maintenance, there are some strategies you can use to try and beat the CMS.

<h2>What is the Child Maintenance Service?</h2>

The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) is a government agency that helps separated parents provide financial support for their children. It was set up to provide a fair and consistent system of child support payments. It is a free service, and it can help to make sure that children receive the financial support they are entitled to.

<h2>How Does the CMS Work?</h2>

The CMS works by calculating the amount of money that the paying parent should be paying for the child's upkeep. This amount is calculated using a formula that takes into account the income of both parents, the number of children and the amount of time each parent spends with the child. The CMS can also help with the assessment of any additional costs, such as school fees or childcare costs.

Once the amount has been calculated, the CMS will contact the paying parent and give them the option to pay via a direct debit arrangement, or to set up a standing order. The parent who is paying the maintenance is also responsible for any additional costs that may arise, such as school fees or childcare costs.

<h2>Strategies for Avoiding Payment</h2>

For some parents, it may be tempting to try and avoid paying for their children’s maintenance. There are some strategies that you can use to try and beat the CMS. 

The first strategy is to try and hide your income. This can be done by taking cash-in-hand jobs, or by setting up a business that does not need to declare income. This may seem like a good idea, but it is illegal, and if you are caught, you can be prosecuted.

The second strategy is to try and claim that you are not the parent of the child. This is also illegal, and you can be prosecuted if you are caught. It is also very difficult to prove that you are not the parent, as there are a number of tests that the CMS can use to determine parentage.

Another strategy is to try and claim that the child does not need the money. This is also illegal, and it can be difficult to prove. The CMS will look at a number of factors when assessing the need for maintenance payments, including the age of the child, their living conditions and whether they are in full-time education.

<h2>The Risk of Avoiding Payment</h2>

It is important to remember that if you are caught trying to avoid paying for your children’s maintenance, you can be prosecuted. The CMS can take legal action against you, and you may be liable for a fine or even a prison sentence. 

It is also important to remember that avoiding maintenance payments can have a big impact on your children. It can affect their living conditions and the quality of their education. It is therefore important to remember that avoiding payments is not in their best interests, and it is important to make sure that they receive the financial support they are entitled to.
