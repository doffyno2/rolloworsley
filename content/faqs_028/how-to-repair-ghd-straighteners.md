<h2>Troubleshooting GHD Straighteners</h2>

If your GHD straightener is not working properly, there are a few simple steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue.

<h3>Check the Cord and Plug</h3>

The first step is to check the cord and plug. Make sure the cord is firmly plugged into the outlet and that there is no damage to the cord or plug. If there is any visible damage or if the cord or plug are not firmly plugged in, contact a qualified electrician to inspect the outlet and cord.

<h3>Check the On/Off Switch</h3>

The next step is to check the on/off switch. Make sure the switch is in the "on" position and that the light is illuminated when the switch is turned on. If the switch is not in the "on" position, move it to the "on" position and then try turning the straightener on again.

<h3>Check the Temperature Control</h3>

If the on/off switch and the cord and plug are working properly, the next step is to check the temperature control. Make sure the temperature is set to the desired level and that the light is illuminated when the temperature is set. If the temperature is not set properly, adjust it to the desired level and then try turning the straightener on again.

<h3>Check the Heating Element</h3>

If the temperature control is working properly, the next step is to check the heating element. Make sure the heating element is not damaged or broken. If it is, contact a qualified technician to replace the heating element.

<h3>Check the Power Reset</h3>

If the heating element is working properly, the next step is to check the power reset. Make sure the power reset switch is in the "on" position. If it is not, move it to the "on" position and then try turning the straightener on again.
