<p>If you're like most homeowners, you rely on your John Deere riding mower to keep your lawn looking its best. But what do you do when your mower won't start? If you don't know how to jumpstart a mower, it can be a frustrating experience. In this article, we'll show you how to jumpstart a John Deere riding mower and get your lawn looking its best in no time.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need to Jumpstart Your Mower</h2>

<p>Before you can jumpstart your mower, you'll need the right tools and supplies. First, you'll need a pair of jumper cables. You'll also need a car or truck with a working battery. If you don't have access to one, you can rent a battery booster at most auto parts stores.</p>

<p>You'll also need a few basic tools, such as a wrench and a screwdriver. You can find these at most hardware stores.</p>

<h2>Steps to Jumpstart Your Mower</h2>

<p>Once you have all the necessary items, you're ready to begin jumpstarting your mower. Here are the steps you'll need to follow:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Park Your Car or Truck Close to Your Mower</h3>

<p>Make sure your car or truck is parked close enough to your mower that you can easily reach the jumper cables to both vehicles. It's also important to make sure your car or truck is turned off.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Connect the Jumper Cables</h3>

<p>Next, you'll need to connect the jumper cables to the batteries of both your mower and your car or truck. Start by connecting one end of the cable to the positive terminal of your mower's battery. Then, connect the other end of the cable to the positive terminal of your car or truck's battery. Make sure both connections are secure.</p>

<p>Next, connect one end of the second cable to the negative terminal of your mower's battery. Then, connect the other end to a metal ground on your car or truck (not the battery). Make sure both connections are secure.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Start Your Car or Truck</h3>

<p>Once the jumper cables are connected, turn on your car or truck and let it run for a few minutes. This will give the battery enough time to charge.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Try Starting Your Mower</h3>

<p>Once your car or truck is running, try starting your mower. If it starts, let it run for a few minutes to ensure the battery is charged. Then, turn off your car or truck and disconnect the jumper cables.</p>

<p>If your mower does not start, you may need to replace the battery. Make sure to take your old battery to an auto parts store for recycling.</p>
