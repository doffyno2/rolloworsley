<p>It is common for drivers to experience some degree of damage to their rims. Whether it is from potholes, rubbing against a curb, or even from a car accident, scratched black rims can be an eyesore. Thankfully, there are a few DIY methods that you can use to repair scratched black rims and restore their original look.</p>

<h2>Supplies Needed </h2>

<p>Before you can begin repairing your rims, you’ll need to gather the necessary supplies. Here’s what you’ll need: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Masking tape</li>
  <li>Sandpaper</li>
  <li>Abrasive metal polish</li>
  <li>Clean cloth</li>
  <li>Rubbing compound</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing the Rim </h2>

<p>Before you can start to repair the rim, you’ll need to prepare the surface. Begin by cleaning the rim with a clean cloth and a mild detergent. This will help remove any dirt, grime, and debris that could interfere with the repair process. Once the rim is clean, you’ll need to mask off the area around the rim with masking tape. This will help prevent any of the polish or sandpaper from getting on the paint.</p>

<h2>Sanding the Rim </h2>

<p>Once the rim is prepped, you’ll need to begin sanding the scratches. Start by using a medium grit sandpaper and lightly sand the scratches. Be sure to sand in a circular motion, as this will help buff out the scratches. Once the scratches are buffed out, you can switch to a fine grit sandpaper and repeat the process. This will help smooth out the surface and ensure that the rim looks as good as new.</p>

<h2>Polishing the Rim </h2>

<p>Once the rim is sanded, you’ll need to begin polishing. Start by applying a small amount of abrasive metal polish to a soft cloth and begin polishing the rim. Be sure to move the cloth in a circular motion, as this will help the polish to penetrate the scratches and restore the original shine. Once the polish has been applied, you can wipe off the excess with a clean cloth.</p>

<h2>Applying a Rubbing Compound </h2>

<p>The final step in repairing your scratched black rims is to apply a rubbing compound. Start by applying a small amount of rubbing compound to a clean cloth and buff out the rim. This will help to remove any remaining scratches and restore the original shine. Once the rubbing compound has been applied, you can wipe off the excess with a clean cloth.</p>
