<p>When the cold months of winter come around, it is essential to have a functioning furnace to keep your home and family warm. But how often should your furnace cycle? To ensure your furnace is running efficiently and safely, it’s important to understand how often it should be cycling. </p>

<h2>What is a Furnace Cycle?</h2>

<p>A furnace cycle is when the furnace turns on, heats up the air in your home, and then turns off. During the cycle, the furnace will use energy to heat up the air in your home.
