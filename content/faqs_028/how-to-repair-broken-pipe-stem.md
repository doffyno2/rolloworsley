<p>A broken pipe stem can be a frustrating and expensive problem. Not only does it cause a leak, but it can also be difficult to repair. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to repair a broken pipe stem and prevent further damage. In this article, we'll cover the basics of how to repair a broken pipe stem.</p>

<h2>Identifying a Broken Pipe Stem</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a broken pipe stem is to identify the problem. You may notice a leak, a crack, or even a hole in the pipe. If you're not sure what you're dealing with, it's best to call a professional plumber to inspect the pipe and diagnose the issue.</p>

<h2>Gathering the Proper Tools and Supplies</h2>

<p>Once you've identified the issue, you'll need to gather the proper tools and supplies to repair the broken pipe stem. Depending on the type of pipe, you'll need a hacksaw, a pipe wrench, plumber's putty, replacement pipe, and PVC primer and glue. Make sure you have all the necessary tools and supplies before you begin the repair.</p>

<h2>Cutting the Pipe</h2>

<p>If the broken pipe stem is beyond repair, you'll need to cut it out and replace it with a new piece. To do this, use a hacksaw to cut the pipe near the broken stem. Make sure to cut the pipe as close to the broken stem as possible. You may also need to use a pipe wrench to remove the broken stem from the pipe.</p>

<h2>Installing the New Pipe</h2>

<p>Once the old pipe has been removed, you can begin installing the new pipe. Apply a thin layer of PVC primer to the outside of the pipe and the inside of the fitting. Once the primer has dried, apply a thin layer of PVC glue to the same surfaces. Then, insert the new pipe into the fitting and twist it into place. Make sure the pipe is secure before moving on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Sealing the Joint</h2>

<p>Once the new pipe is installed, you'll need to seal the joint to ensure a watertight seal. To do this, apply a generous amount of plumber's putty to the joint and press it into place. Make sure to cover the entire joint and check for any leaks before you move on.</p>

<h2>Testing the Pipe</h2>
