<p>If you’ve noticed rust on your door frame, you’re probably wondering how you can repair it. Rusting is a common problem for door frames, as water can easily seep in through the frame and cause corrosion. To fix a rusted door frame, you’ll need to clean off the rust, fill any cracks or holes with a rust-resistant filler, and then paint the frame. With a few supplies and a bit of effort, you can make your door frame look like new again!</p>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Door Frame</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a rusted door frame is to clean off the rust. You can do this by using a wire brush, steel wool, or a sanding block. Start by brushing away as much of the rust as you can, then use a steel wool pad to get into crevices and remove any remaining rust. Once you’ve finished cleaning the frame, use a vacuum to remove any rust or dust particles from the frame.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Fill Any Cracks or Holes</h2>

<p>Once the frame is clean, you’ll need to fill any cracks or holes with a rust-resistant filler. To do this, you’ll need to purchase a rust-resistant filler, such as Rust-Oleum Rust Reformer. Follow the directions on the product to apply the filler and allow it to dry. Once it’s dried, you’ll be ready to move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Paint the Frame</h2>

<p>The final step in repairing a rusted door frame is to paint it. You’ll want to use a rust-resistant paint, such as Rust-Oleum Rust Reformer. Start by applying a coat of primer, then one or two coats of paint. Make sure the paint is completely dry before you close the door.</p>
