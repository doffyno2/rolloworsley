<h2>What is ELO?</h2>

<p>ELO is a ranking system used in various competitive games, such as League of Legends, Dota 2, and Counter Strike: Global Offensive. The ELO system was developed by Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-American physics professor, in the 1940s and is based on the idea that the performance of each player in a given game is correlated to the performance of all other players in that game. The ELO system assigns each player a rating, which is then used to determine their matchmaking rating (MMR). The higher the MMR, the better the player’s chances of winning in competitive games.</p>

<h2>How Does ELO Work?</h2>

<p>The ELO system is based on the idea that the performance of each player in a given game is correlated to the performance of all other players in that game. The ELO system assigns each player a rating, which is then used to determine their matchmaking rating (MMR). If a player wins against an opponent with a higher MMR, they will gain more points than if they had won against an opponent with a lower MMR. Conversely, if a player loses to an opponent with a lower MMR, they will lose more points than if they had lost to an opponent with a higher MMR. As a result, players with higher MMRs will usually be paired with players with similar MMRs, ensuring that the competition is fair and balanced.</p>
