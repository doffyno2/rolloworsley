In this article, we’ll discuss how to clean a Blackstone griddle to keep it looking and performing like new.</p>

<h2>Cleaning a Blackstone Griddle</h2>

<p>When it comes to cleaning a Blackstone griddle, there are a few simple steps you can take to ensure that it’s properly cleaned and maintained. The following are some tips for cleaning your Blackstone griddle.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Remove Food and Grease</h3>

<p>The first step in cleaning your Blackstone griddle is to remove any food and grease. To do this, use a scraper to remove any food particles that may be stuck to the griddle. You may also want to use a paper towel or dish rag to wipe away any grease or oil that may have accumulated on the griddle.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Scrub the Griddle</h3>

<p>Once all of the food and grease have been removed, you can begin scrubbing the griddle. To do this, use a soft-bristled brush or a non-metallic scrubber to scrub the griddle in a circular motion. Make sure to pay special attention to the corners and edges of the griddle where food particles and grease can accumulate.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Rinse the Griddle</h3>

<p>After scrubbing the griddle, it’s important to rinse it off. Use a damp cloth or paper towel to wipe away any remaining residue. Be sure to rinse the griddle thoroughly and make sure all of the soapy residue is removed.</p>

<p>Once the griddle has been rinsed, it’s important to dry it off. Use a paper towel or a clean cloth to dry the griddle. Make sure to dry it completely so that there isn’t any moisture left on the griddle.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Re-season the Griddle</h3>

<p>Once the griddle has been dried, it’s important to re-season it. To do this, use a light layer of vegetable oil or shortening to coat the surface of the griddle. Use a paper towel or a clean cloth to spread the oil or shortening over the griddle. Allow the oil or shortening to sit on the griddle for 10 minutes, then wipe off any excess. Your griddle is now ready to use.</p>
