<h2>Why Steps Get Too High</h2>

<p>Steps can become too high for a variety of reasons. The most common cause is wear and tear over time, as a step's material can become worn down due to age and general use.

Poor maintenance can also be a factor, as steps that are not regularly inspected and maintained can become higher than they should be. Finally, steps can become higher due to changes in the foundation or the ground beneath the steps, which can cause the steps to become higher over time.</p>
