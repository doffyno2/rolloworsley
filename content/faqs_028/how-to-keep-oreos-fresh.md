Oreos are a classic treat that never seem to go out of style. They are beloved by children and adults alike, and their iconic cookie-and-cream combination is hard to beat. Whether you're stocking up on Oreos for a party or just for snacking purposes, you want to make sure that your cookies stay fresh for as long as possible. Here are some tips on how to keep Oreos fresh.

<h2>Store Oreos in an Airtight Container</h2>

The best way to keep Oreos fresh is to store them in an airtight container. This will help to keep out moisture, which can cause Oreos to become soft and stale. The container should be large enough to hold all of your Oreos, and it should be made of a material that will not allow air to get in. Glass and plastic are both good choices.

<h2>Keep Oreos Away From Heat and Humidity</h2>

Heat and humidity can both cause Oreos to become stale or mushy. To prevent this, make sure that you store Oreos away from direct sources of heat, such as radiators or heating vents. If possible, avoid storing Oreos in damp areas, such as near a bathroom or laundry room.

<h2>Keep Oreos Away From Strong Smells</h2>

<h2>Eat Stale Oreos in Moderation</h2>

If your Oreos have become stale, you can still enjoy them, but it's important to eat them in moderation. Stale Oreos can be harder to digest, so it's best to eat them in small amounts. You can also try adding a few drops of milk to the cookies to soften them up.

<h2>Freeze Oreos to Preserve Freshness</h2>
