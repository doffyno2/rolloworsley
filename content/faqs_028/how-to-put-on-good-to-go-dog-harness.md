Good To Go dog harnesses are a great way to keep your pup safe and secure while out on walks. They provide support for your dog’s chest and abdomen, helping to evenly distribute the weight of the leash. The Good To Go dog harness is designed to be comfortable and easy to use, making it a great choice for both novice and experienced pet owners. In this article, we’ll walk you through how to put on a Good To Go Dog Harness.

<h2>Choosing the Right Size Harness</h2>

The first step to putting on a Good To Go Dog Harness is to choose the right size. The harness should fit snugly around your dog’s chest and abdomen, without constricting or being too loose. You’ll want to measure your pup’s chest and abdomen before purchasing a harness, as the size will vary depending on the breed and size of the dog. It’s also important to consider the weight of your pup. If your pup is a larger breed, you’ll want to opt for a larger size harness.

<h2>Preparing Your Dog for the Harness</h2>

Before you put on the harness, you’ll want to ensure that your pup is comfortable with it. Start by placing the harness on the floor and letting your pup investigate it. You can also offer treats or toys to help your pup get used to the harness. Once your pup is comfortable with the harness, you can start to get them used to having it on.

<h2>Putting On the Harness</h2>

The next step is to put the harness on your pup. Start by placing the harness on the floor and buckling it loosely. Then, place it around your pup’s chest and abdomen, making sure it’s not too tight or too loose. Lastly, buckle the harness securely, but not too tight.

<h2>Adjusting the Harness</h2>

Once the harness is on, you’ll want to adjust it to make sure it fits properly. Start by loosening the straps and then tightening them so that they fit snugly against your pup’s chest and abdomen. You may need to adjust the straps several times to get the perfect fit.

<h2>Double-Checking the Harness</h2>

Once you’ve adjusted the harness, it’s important to double-check that it’s secure and comfortable. You should be able to slide two fingers between the harness and your pup’s chest and abdomen. If it’s too tight, you may need to adjust the straps again.

<h2>Attaching the Leash</h2>

Once you’ve secured the harness, you can attach the leash. Make sure the leash is securely attached to the harness, and that it’s not too tight or too loose. You may need to adjust the leash several times to get the perfect fit.
