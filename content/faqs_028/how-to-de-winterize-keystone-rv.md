Winterizing your RV is an important part of the camping experience, but de winterizing it is just as important. De winterizing your RV ensures that it is ready for use as soon as the weather starts to get warmer. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to de winterize your Keystone RV.

<h2>Step 1: Drain the Antifreeze</h2>

The first step in de winterizing your Keystone RV is to drain all of the antifreeze from the system. Antifreeze is used to keep the pipes from freezing in cold weather, but it needs to be drained before you can use the RV in warm weather. Start by draining the antifreeze from the fresh water tank. Next, turn off the water pump, and use a siphon to remove the remaining antifreeze from the lines.

<h2>Step 2: Flush and Sanitize the System</h2>

Once the antifreeze has been drained, it’s time to flush and sanitize the system. Start by filling the fresh water tank with a solution of one part bleach and four parts water. Turn on the water pump and let the solution run through the lines for at least 15 minutes. Once the solution has been running for 15 minutes, turn off the water pump and let the solution sit for at least an hour. After an hour, flush the system with clear water until it runs clear.

<h2>Step 3: Test the System</h2>

Once the system has been flushed and sanitized, it’s time to test it. Turn on the water pump and let the water run through the lines for a few minutes. Check for any leaks or clogs in the lines. If there are any leaks or clogs, fix them before continuing.

<h2>Step 4: Refill the Fresh Water Tank</h2>

Once the system has been tested and any leaks or clogs have been fixed, it’s time to refill the fresh water tank. Fill the tank with clean, potable water and turn on the water pump. Let the water run through the lines for a few minutes to ensure that the lines are clear.

<h2>Step 5: Check the Appliances</h2>

Once the fresh water tank has been refilled and the lines have been tested, it’s time to check the appliances. Check the water heater, refrigerator, and any other appliances that use water to ensure that they are working properly. If any of the appliances are not working properly, troubleshoot them and make any necessary repairs before continuing.

<h2>Step 6: Check the Plumbing Fixtures</h2>

The final step in de winterizing your Keystone RV is to check the plumbing fixtures. Check all of the sinks, toilets, and showers to make sure that the water is running properly and that there are no leaks or clogs. If there are any leaks or clogs, fix them before continuing.
