<h2>What Are Cellular Window Blinds?</h2>
<p>Cellular window blinds are a popular window covering choice for many homes. They are made of individual cells, or pockets, of fabric or other material that are designed to trap air and create an insulating barrier between the window and the room.

Cellular window blinds also come in a variety of colors, textures, and sizes, making them a versatile and attractive option for any home.</p>
