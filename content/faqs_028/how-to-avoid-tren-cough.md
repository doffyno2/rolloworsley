It’s that time of year again – cold and flu season. You’re surrounded by sick people at work, school and home, and you’re desperate to avoid catching a cold. But how can you stay healthy and avoid getting sick? Here are some tips to help you stay healthy and avoid catching a cold.

<h2>Practice Good Hygiene</h2>

The best way to avoid catching a cold is to practice good hygiene. Wash your hands frequently, especially after you’ve been in contact with someone who is sick. Use soap and water and scrub your hands thoroughly for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.

Also, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, as these are the main routes of transmission for cold and flu viruses.

<h2>Boost Your Immune System</h2>

Your immune system is your body’s defense against infections, so it’s important to keep it strong and healthy. Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly and get plenty of rest. Also, make sure to get all of the recommended vaccinations, such as the flu shot.

<h2>Avoid Close Contact with Sick People</h2>

If someone in your family or workplace is sick, try to avoid coming in contact with them. If you must be in the same room, keep at least 3 feet away from them.

<h2>Clean and Disinfect Surfaces</h2>

Cold and flu viruses can live on surfaces for several hours, so it’s important to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces, such as doorknobs, light switches, keyboards and phones. Use a household cleaner or a solution of bleach and water to disinfect surfaces.

<h2>Wear a Mask</h2>

If you’re in close contact with someone who is sick, wear a face mask. This will help to prevent you from inhaling any of the virus particles that may be in the air.

<h2>Stay Home When Sick</h2>

If you’re feeling sick, stay home until you’re feeling better. This will help to prevent you from spreading the virus to others.
