<p>Granite is a natural stone that is increasingly popular for use in home decor and remodeling projects. Granite is durable, long lasting and adds a unique, classic look to any room or outdoor space. Many granite countertops, tiles and other surfaces are finished with a rounded edge, or bullnose, for a softer, more pleasing look. If you're looking to create a polished edge on your granite surface, you'll need to use a few tools and techniques. Read on to learn how to polish a granite edge.</p>
