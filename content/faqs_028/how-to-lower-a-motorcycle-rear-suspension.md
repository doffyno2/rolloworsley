<p>If you’re a motorcycle enthusiast and you’re looking for a way to customize your ride, one of the best ways to do that is to lower your motorcycle’s rear suspension. Lowering the rear suspension of your bike can give it a more aggressive look, which can be a great way to stand out from the crowd. It can also reduce the weight of your motorcycle, which can improve its handling and performance. </p>

<p>Lowering your motorcycle’s rear suspension isn’t a difficult task, but it does require some mechanical know-how and the right tools. In this article, we’ll take a look at how to lower a motorcycle rear suspension so you can get the look and performance you’re after. </p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies You’ll Need</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need to make sure you have all the necessary tools and supplies. Here’s a list of what you’ll need: </p>

<ul>
  <li>A socket wrench set</li>
  <li>A torque wrench</li>
  <li>An adjustable wrench</li>
  <li>A jack stand</li>
  <li>A jack</li>
  <li>A block of wood</li>
  <li>A ruler</li>
  <li>A spring compressor</li>
  <li>A set of spring spacers</li>
  <li>A sealant and lubricant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Measure Your Rear Suspension</h2>

<p>Before you begin the process of lowering your rear suspension, you need to take some measurements. This will help you determine how much you need to lower your suspension, and will also help you to properly adjust your suspension once you’re done. </p>

<p>To measure your rear suspension, you’ll need to use a ruler or tape measure. Measure the distance between the top of the rear shock and the bottom of the swingarm. This measurement is known as the “ride height”. You’ll need to record this measurement so you can properly adjust your suspension later. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Rear Shock</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve taken your measurements, it’s time to remove the rear shock. Begin by raising the rear of the bike using a jack and a jack stand. Make sure the bike is securely supported before you begin working. </p>

<p>Once the bike is secure, use your socket wrench set to loosen the bolts that hold the shock to the swingarm. Once the bolts are loose, you can remove the shock from the bike. You may need to use an adjustable wrench to loosen the nuts on the shock. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Install the Spring Spacers</h2>

<p>Now that the shock is removed, you can begin installing the spring spacers. The spring spacers will help to lower your rear suspension by providing additional space between the shock and the swingarm. </p>

<p>To install the spring spacers, you’ll need to use a spring compressor. This tool will help to compress the spring so you can install the spacers. Make sure to follow the instructions that come with your spring compressor carefully. </p>

<p>Once the spacers are installed, make sure to apply a sealant and lubricant to the threads of the bolts to ensure a secure fit. </p>

<h2>Step 4: Re-install the Shock</h2>

<p>Now that the spring spacers are installed, you can re-install the shock. Begin by placing the shock back in its original position. Use a block of wood to help support the shock while you re-install the bolts. </p>

<p>Once the shock is in place, use your socket wrench set to tighten the bolts. Make sure to use a torque wrench to ensure the bolts are tightened to the proper torque specifications. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Adjust the Ride Height</h2>

<p>Once the shock is re-installed, it’s time to adjust the ride height. Begin by measuring the distance between the top of the rear shock and the bottom of the swingarm. Make sure the measurement matches the original measurement you took before removing the shock. </p>

<p>If the measurements don’t match, you may need to adjust the preload on the suspension. If the measurements are off by more than a few millimeters, you may need to add or remove spring spacers. </p>

<h2>Step 6: Test Ride Your Bike</h2>

<p>Once you’ve adjusted the ride height, it’s time to take your bike for a test ride. Make sure to take it easy and pay attention to how the bike feels. If you feel any strange vibrations or noises, stop immediately and check for loose bolts or other issues. </p>
