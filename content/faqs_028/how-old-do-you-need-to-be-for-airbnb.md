Airbnb is an online platform that enables people to list and rent short-term lodging accommodations in various locations around the world. It’s a great way to find affordable, quality accommodation in places you may never have considered before. But before you can take advantage of Airbnb’s services, you need to know how old you have to be to use the platform.

<h2>What is the Minimum Age Requirement for Airbnb?</h2>

The minimum age requirement for Airbnb is 18 years old. This applies to both hosts and guests. If you’re under 18, you won’t be able to use the platform at all.

<h2>What If I’m Under 18?</h2>

If you’re under 18 and still want to use Airbnb, you can have a parent or guardian create an account on your behalf. They will then be able to book accommodations for you and you’ll be able to stay in those accommodations.

<h2>What If I’m Over 18?</h2>

If you’re over 18, you can create your own account on Airbnb and book accommodations for yourself. You don’t need any special permission or documents to do this, just your valid government issued ID.

<h2>What If I’m Under 21?</h2>

If you’re under 21, you may have difficulty booking certain types of accommodations. For example, some properties may require you to be 21 or older to book a room. In these cases, you may need an adult or legal guardian to help you book the room.

<h2>What If I’m Hosting and Under 21?</h2>

If you’re hosting and under 21, you should be aware that some guests may not be comfortable staying in your property. You may want to consider adding an age restriction on your property so that only guests 21 and over can book it.

<h2>What If I Have a Group and Some People Are Under 21?</h2>

If you have a group and some people are under 21, you should check with the host to make sure that they are okay with the group. Some hosts may not be comfortable with guests under 21 and may require that all guests be 21 or over.
