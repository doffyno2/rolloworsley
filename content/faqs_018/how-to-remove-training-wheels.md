<p>Training wheels are a great way to help your child learn how to ride a bicycle. However, once your child has mastered the basics of riding, it is time to take off the training wheels and let them ride without them. Removing the training wheels is a simple task, but it is important to do it correctly in order to ensure the safety of your child. In this article, we will discuss the steps you need to take to safely and effectively remove the training wheels from your childâ€™s bicycle.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Gather Your Supplies</h2>

<p>Before you begin removing the training wheels, gather all of the necessary supplies. You will need a wrench, a screwdriver, and a pair of pliers. Once you have all of your supplies, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Loosen the Bolts</h2>

<p>Once you have all of your supplies, you need to locate the bolts that secure the training wheels to the frame of the bicycle. Using the wrench, loosen the bolts until they are loose enough to remove. Do not remove the bolts completely yet, as you will need them to reattach the training wheels later.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Training Wheels</h2>

<p>Once you have loosened the bolts, you can now remove the training wheels. Use the screwdriver to carefully lift the training wheels away from the frame of the bicycle. Once they have been removed, you can set them aside until they are needed again.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Tighten the Bolts</h2>

<p>Once the training wheels have been removed, you need to tighten the bolts that secure the frame of the bicycle. Using the wrench, tighten the bolts until they are secure. Be sure not to overtighten the bolts, as this could damage the frame.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Test the Bicycle</h2>

<p>Once the training wheels have been removed and the bolts are tightened, it is time to test the bicycle. Have your child sit on the bicycle and make sure that it is stable and secure. If the bicycle is stable and secure, your child is ready to ride without training wheels.</p>
