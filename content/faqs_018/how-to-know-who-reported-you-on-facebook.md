When someone reports you on Facebook, the content or behavior in question is reviewed by a team of Facebook moderators. The moderators will decide if the content or behavior violates Facebook’s Community Standards and, if so, they will take the necessary action to remove it. Depending on the severity of the violation, the moderators may also take additional steps such as suspending or banning your account.
