<p>Ballpoint pens are a convenient way to write, but can be frustrating when they don't work properly. If your ballpoint pen is not writing, there are a few simple steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue and get it working again. In this article, we'll cover how to diagnose and fix common ballpoint pen problems.</p>

<h2>Check the Ink Level</h2>

<p>The first thing you should do when your ballpoint pen is not writing is to check the ink level. If the pen is running out of ink, the tip may not be able to produce a steady flow of ink, which can cause it to stop writing. To check the ink level, remove the cap and look at the ink cartridge. If it is almost empty, you will need to replace it.</p>

<h2>Clean the Tip</h2>

<p>If the ink level is sufficient, you may have an issue with the tip of the pen. If the tip is clogged or dirty, the ink may not be able to flow freely. You can use a cotton swab or paper towel to gently clean the tip. Dip the swab or paper towel in rubbing alcohol and gently wipe the tip of the pen until it is clean. Once it is cleaned, try writing again to see if this fixes the issue.</p>

<h2>Adjust the Tip</h2>

<p>If the tip of the pen is misaligned, this can also cause it to stop writing. The tip should be aligned so that it is pointing directly down when the pen is held in a writing position. If the tip is misaligned, you can gently adjust it using a pair of tweezers. Be careful not to apply too much pressure when adjusting the tip, as this could damage the pen.</p>

<h2>Replace the Cartridge</h2>

<p>If the issue persists after cleaning and adjusting the tip, it may be time to replace the ink cartridge. To do this, remove the old cartridge and insert a new one. Make sure the new cartridge is compatible with your pen before inserting it. Once the cartridge has been replaced, try writing again to see if this solved the issue.</p>
