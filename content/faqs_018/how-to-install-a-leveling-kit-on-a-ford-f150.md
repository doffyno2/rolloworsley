How to Install a Leveling Kit on a Ford F150


Installing a leveling kit onto a Ford F150 truck is a relatively straightforward job that can be completed in a few hours. A leveling kit is a simple way to raise the front end of the vehicle, making it look bigger and more aggressive. It also helps improve the overall performance of the truck, as it prevents the front wheels from bottoming out. In this article, we will discuss the steps involved in installing a leveling kit onto a Ford F150.

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

Before you start the installation process, make sure you have all the tools you need. The most important tool you will need is a socket wrench. You will also need a jack, jack stands, a level, and a few other basic tools.

<h2>Step 1: Jack Up the Truck</h2>

The first step is to jack up the truck and place it on jack stands. Make sure the truck is securely supported before you begin.

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Existing Struts</h2>

Once the truck is securely supported, you can begin removing the existing struts. To do this, use a socket wrench to remove the bolts that secure the struts to the frame. Once the bolts are removed, the struts can be pulled out of the vehicle.

<h2>Step 3: Install the Leveling Kit</h2>

Next, you will need to install the leveling kit. This kit will consist of new struts, spacers, and bolts. Begin by attaching the new struts to the frame with the supplied bolts. Make sure the struts are securely attached and that they are level.

<h2>Step 4: Install the Spacers</h2>

Once the struts are securely attached, you can begin installing the spacers. The spacers will raise the front end of the truck and give it a more aggressive look. Start by installing the spacers onto the struts and then tightening them down with a socket wrench.

<h2>Step 5: Reattach the Wheels</h2>

Once the spacers are securely attached, you can reattach the wheels. Make sure the wheels are securely attached and that the lug nuts are tightened down properly.

<h2>Step 6: Check for Level</h2>

Finally, use a level to make sure the truck is level. If it is not, you may need to make some adjustments to the spacers.
