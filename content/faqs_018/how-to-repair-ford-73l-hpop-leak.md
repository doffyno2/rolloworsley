<p>A High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP) leak on a Ford 7.3L diesel engine can be a serious issue. A leaking HPOP can cause a vehicle to lose power or even stall. In this article, we will discuss the causes of a HPOP leak as well as the steps you can take to repair it.</p>

<h2>What Causes a HPOP Leak?</h2>

<p>A HPOP leak can be caused by a variety of issues, including worn seals, defective O-rings, or a damaged HPOP. The most common cause is a worn seal, which can be caused by excessive heat or age. This can cause oil to leak from the pump and can lead to a decrease in performance.</p>

<h2>How to Identify a HPOP Leak</h2>

<p>The first step in diagnosing a HPOP leak is to identify the source of the leak. To do this, start the vehicle and look for any signs of oil leakage. If there is oil present, then it is likely that the leak is coming from the HPOP. If there is no visible leakage, then it is possible that the leak is coming from one of the other components in the system.</p>

<h2>How to Repair a HPOP Leak</h2>

<p>Once the source of the leak has been identified, the next step is to repair the leak. The most common solution is to replace the seals and O-rings on the HPOP. This can be done by removing the pump from the vehicle and replacing the seals. If the pump is damaged, then it may need to be replaced altogether.</p>

<h2>How to Prevent a HPOP Leak</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent a HPOP leak is to make sure that the oil level is maintained and the seals are replaced regularly. The oil should be changed at least every 5,000 miles and the seals should be replaced every 10,000 miles. Additionally, it is important to keep an eye on the temperature of the engine, as excessive heat can cause the seals to wear down faster.</p>
