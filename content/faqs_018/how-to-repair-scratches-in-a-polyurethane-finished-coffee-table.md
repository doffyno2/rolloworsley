<p>Polyurethane is a protective coating that is applied to furniture and other surfaces to protect them from wear, tear, and moisture. It is a durable material, but it can get scratched. Fortunately, there are a few methods you can use to repair a polyurethane finished coffee table that has been scratched.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>
<p>To repair scratches in a polyurethane finished coffee table, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fine steel wool</li>
<li>Mineral oil</li>
<li>Soft cloth</li>
<li>Wood putty</li>
<li>Sandpaper</li>
<li>Wood finish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Surface</h2>
<p>Before you start repairing the scratches, you need to make sure the surface of the coffee table is clean. Use a soft cloth and some mineral oil to gently wipe down the surface of the table. This will remove any dirt and debris that can get in the way of the repair process.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Repair the Scratch</h2>
<p>Once the surface is clean, you can start repairing the scratch. Depending on the type and size of the scratch, you can use either steel wool or wood putty to fill the area. If the scratch is very small, use the steel wool to buff it out. If the scratch is larger, use wood putty to fill it in. Make sure to apply the putty in small amounts and use a soft cloth to smooth it out.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Sand and Finish</h2>
<p>Once you have filled in the scratch, you need to sand the area to make sure it is even with the rest of the surface. Use a piece of fine-grit sandpaper and gently sand the area until it is smooth. Then, apply a wood finish to the area to seal it. This will help protect the area and make the repair last longer.</p>
