<p>When you and your companion share a bond, it’s important to make sure that the source collar is taken off in the correct way. Not only is the source collar a valuable item to your companion, but it can be a safety hazard if not taken off properly. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to get the source collar off your companion.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Gather the Necessary Tools</h2>

<p>Before you can start taking the source collar off your companion, you need to have the right tools to do so. The most important tool is a pair of needle-nose pliers. You’ll also need a Phillips screwdriver, a flat-head screwdriver, and a pair of scissors. Make sure you have all the necessary tools before you begin the process of taking the source collar off your companion.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Collar Screws</h2>

<p>Once you have all the necessary tools, you’ll need to remove the screws that are holding the source collar together. There are usually two screws on each side of the collar. Use the Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws, and then carefully lift the collar away from your companion’s neck.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Cut the Collar Loops</h2>

<p>Once the screws are removed, you’ll need to cut the loops that are holding the source collar on your companion. Use the scissors to carefully cut the loops. Be careful not to cut too close to your companion’s skin, as this could cause unnecessary pain or discomfort.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Remove the Collar from the Neck</h2>

<p>Once the loops have been cut, you can now remove the source collar from your companion’s neck. Use the flat-head screwdriver to gently pry the collar away from the neck. Be careful not to scratch or damage the skin in the process.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Remove the Collar Pieces</h2>

<p>Once the source collar is removed from your companion’s neck, you’ll need to remove the individual pieces of the collar. Use the needle-nose pliers to carefully remove the pieces from the source collar. Make sure to remove all of the pieces before disposing of the source collar.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Clean the Neck Area</h2>

<p>Once the source collar has been removed, you should clean the neck area of your companion. Use a damp cloth to gently clean the area. Make sure to avoid using any soap or other harsh cleaning products that could irritate your companion’s skin.</p>
