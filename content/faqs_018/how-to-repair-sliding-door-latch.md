Sliding doors are a great way to add a modern touch to any home. However, with their convenience comes the occasional need for repair. Sliding door latches can become worn or broken over time, leaving them unable to keep the door closed. Fortunately, repairing a sliding door latch is a relatively simple process that most homeowners can do with basic tools.
