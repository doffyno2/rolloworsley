<h2>What is Scryers Reputation?</h2>

<p>Scryers reputation is a faction associated with the Aldor and Scryers in the game World of Warcraft. It is a player-versus-player (PvP) faction, as opposed to a player-versus-environment (PvE) one. Players can earn Scryers reputation by completing quests, killing certain mobs and participating in PvP events. As players increase their reputation with the Scryers, they can gain access to better rewards, such as mounts, armor, weapons and more.</p>
