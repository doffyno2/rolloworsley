<p>For those looking to mix up their hot dog cooking, broiling hot dogs in the oven is an excellent option. It’s just as simple as cooking them on the stovetop, but with a few more steps. Here’s how to do it.</p>

<h2>Prepare the Oven</h2>

<p>Start by preheating the oven to 500°F. While the oven is preheating, prepare a shallow baking pan with a layer of foil. Make sure the layer of foil is thick enough to withstand high temperatures, as the oven will be set to its highest setting. Place the hot dogs onto the foil-lined pan and spread them out evenly.</p>

<h2>Broil the Hot Dogs</h2>

<p>Once the oven has reached 500°F, place the pan of hot dogs directly under the broiler. Let the hot dogs cook for about five minutes, or until they’re golden brown. Keep an eye on them to ensure they don’t overcook.</p>

<h2>Serve the Hot Dogs</h2>

<p>Once the hot dogs are done cooking, remove them from the oven and place them on a plate. Serve with your favorite condiments and toppings, such as ketchup, mustard, relish, or sauerkraut. Enjoy!</p>
