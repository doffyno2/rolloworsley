We’ve all been there – you fill your plastic water bottle with soapy water and it ends up smelling like a bubble bath! You don’t want to drink out of it and you don’t want to throw it away. Luckily, there are some simple steps you can take to get rid of that soap smell and make your bottle smell fresh and clean again. 

<h2>What Causes the Soap Smell?</h2> 

Soap is designed to dissolve in water, but when it is left in a plastic water bottle, the soap molecules can stick to the sides of the bottle, which can leave a soapy residue. This residue can cause a strong soap smell that can be hard to get rid of. 

<h2>How to Get the Smell Out of Your Plastic Water Bottle</h2> 

<h3>1. Use Hot Water and Baking Soda</h3>

The first step is to fill your plastic water bottle with hot water and add a few tablespoons of baking soda. Let this mixture sit for about an hour, then rinse the bottle out with cold water. The baking soda will help to neutralize the soap smell and leave your bottle smelling fresh. 

<h3>2. Use White Vinegar</h3>

Another option is to fill the bottle with a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and hot water and let it sit overnight. The vinegar will help to break down the soap residue and get rid of the smell. In the morning, rinse the bottle out with cold water and it should be smelling fresh and clean. 

<h3>3. Use Lemon Juice and Salt</h3>

If you don’t have any white vinegar or baking soda on hand, you can also try using lemon juice and salt. Mix together equal parts lemon juice and hot water and add a few teaspoons of salt. Let the mixture sit for about an hour, then rinse out the bottle with cold water. The lemon juice and salt will help to break down the soap residue and get rid of the smell. 

<h3>4. Use Baking Powder</h3>

Baking powder is another great option for getting rid of the soap smell in your plastic water bottle. Simply fill the bottle with hot water and add a few tablespoons of baking powder. Let it sit for about an hour, then rinse out the bottle with cold water. The baking powder will neutralize the soap smell and leave your bottle smelling fresh and clean.

<h3>5. Use Activated Charcoal</h3>

Activated charcoal is another great option for getting rid of the soap smell in your plastic water bottle. Simply fill the bottle with hot water and add a few tablespoons of activated charcoal. Let it sit for about an hour, then rinse out the bottle with cold water. The activated charcoal will help to absorb the soap smell and leave your bottle smelling fresh and clean.
