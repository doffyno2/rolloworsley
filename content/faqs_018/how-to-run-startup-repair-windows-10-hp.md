<p>If your HP computer is running Windows 10, then you may have experienced some technical issues that require you to run startup repair. Startup repair is a feature of Windows 10 that can help repair a computer’s operating system and get it back up and running. Although startup repair can be a useful tool, it should only be used after all other troubleshooting steps have been exhausted. This guide will teach you how to run startup repair on a Windows 10 HP computer.</p>

<h2>What is Startup Repair?</h2>

<p>Startup repair is a feature of Windows 10 that can help repair a computer’s operating system and get it back up and running. It can be used to fix issues such as missing or corrupt system files, a damaged registry, an incompatible driver, or an incorrect system configuration. Startup repair can also help repair Windows components such as the Start Menu, the Taskbar, or the Desktop. It is important to remember that startup repair should only be used as a last resort, after all other troubleshooting steps have been exhausted.</p>

<h2>How to Run Startup Repair on a Windows 10 HP Computer</h2>

<p>The first step to running startup repair on a Windows 10 HP computer is to boot the computer into Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE). This can be done by pressing and holding the power button for at least 5 seconds. After the computer has been powered off, press the power button again to turn the computer back on. When the HP logo appears on the screen, press F11 repeatedly until the WinRE screen appears. Once the WinRE screen appears, select “Troubleshoot”, then “Advanced options”, then “Startup Repair”.</p>

<p>The next step is to follow the on-screen instructions to begin the startup repair process. The startup repair process can take several minutes to complete, so it is important to be patient. Once the startup repair process has been completed, the computer will restart and the Windows 10 operating system will be restored. If the startup repair process was successful, the computer should now be running properly.</p>
