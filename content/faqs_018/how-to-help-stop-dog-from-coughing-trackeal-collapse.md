<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Tracheal Collapse?</h2>

<p>The main symptom of tracheal collapse is a dry, hacking cough. Other symptoms include wheezing, labored breathing, and gagging. Your pup may also seem listless or weak. If you think your pup may have tracheal collapse, it’s important to take them to the vet as soon as possible for a proper diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<h2>How Is Tracheal Collapse Diagnosed and Treated?</h2>
