<p>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an open-world action role-playing video game developed and published by CD Projekt. It is the third and final installment in the series, and was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in May 2015. The game features a vast open world for players to explore, as well as a variety of weapons, armor, and items to find and craft. Unfortunately, even the best weapons can get damaged in the heat of battle, leaving you with a less-than-ideal weapon to battle your foes. Fortunately, there are ways to repair your damaged weapons and keep them in top fighting shape.</p>

<h2>What Causes Weapons to Become Damaged in Witcher 3?</h2>

<p>Weapons in Witcher 3 can become damaged in a variety of ways. The most common cause of weapon damage is simply using it too much. Every time you swing your weapon in battle, its durability will decrease, and if you use it too much you will eventually reach a point where the weapon is no longer usable. Other causes of weapon damage include exposure to extreme temperatures, corrosion from certain environments, and being struck by powerful magical attacks. </p>

<h2>How to Repair Damaged Weapons in Witcher 3</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a damaged weapon in Witcher 3 is to find a blacksmith. Blacksmiths can be found in most major cities and towns, and can repair your weapons for a fee. Simply talk to the blacksmith and they will be able to tell you how much it will cost to repair your weapon, as well as how long it will take. </p>

<p>If you are not near a blacksmith, or you would prefer to repair your weapon yourself, you can do so using a few simple alchemical ingredients. The most common ingredient used to repair weapons is aetherium, which can be found by mining ore veins or purchased from merchants. To repair a weapon, simply combine aetherium with a few other ingredients in a mortar and pestle. </p>

<h2>What Ingredients Are Needed to Repair Weapons in Witcher 3?</h2>

<p>In addition to aetherium, several other alchemical ingredients are needed to repair weapons in Witcher 3. These ingredients include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>Powdered Amber – This is a common alchemical ingredient that can be found in most alchemical shops. </li>
    <li>Troll Fat – This is a rare ingredient that can be found in the remains of slain trolls. </li>
    <li>Slave’s Stomach – This is a rare ingredient that can be found in the remains of slain slaves. </li>
    <li>Crow’s Beak – This is a rare ingredient that can be found in the remains of slain crows. </li>
    <li>Toadstool – This is a common alchemical ingredient that can be found in most alchemical shops. </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have gathered all of the required ingredients, combine them in a mortar and pestle and use the resulting mixture to repair your weapon. </p>

<h2>What Other Tips Are There for Repairing Weapons in Witcher 3?</h2>

<p>In addition to the above tips on repairing weapons in Witcher 3, there are a few other tips that can help you keep your weapons in top fighting shape.
