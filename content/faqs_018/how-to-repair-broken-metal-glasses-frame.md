How to Repair Broken Metal Glasses Frame

Nobody likes having to replace their glasses frames, especially when those frames are made of metal. Metal frames are typically more expensive, so it’s a real bummer when you have to replace them due to damage. But what if you could repair them yourself? It’s actually very possible to repair broken metal glasses frames and save yourself a lot of money. Here’s what you need to know.

<h2>Inspect the Frames</h2>
Before you can even begin trying to repair the frames, you need to inspect them for damage. This is a vital step, as it will help you determine the extent of the damage and the best way to repair it. Start by looking at the frame closely. Are there any bent parts? Are any of the screws missing? Are there any cracks or fractures? Make sure to take a look at the lenses too, as they may be damaged as well.

<h2>Remove the Lenses</h2>
Once you’ve determined the extent of the damage, you’ll need to remove the lenses from the frames. This is usually done by unscrewing the screws that hold them in place. Make sure you have the right tools for the job, such as a pair of needle-nose pliers or a small screwdriver. Be careful not to damage the lenses as you remove them.

<h2>Straighten the Frame</h2>
If the frame is bent or has any other deformities, you’ll need to straighten it out before trying to repair it. This can be done by using a pair of pliers or an adjustable wrench. Just be careful not to apply too much pressure, as you may end up breaking the frame.

<h2>Repair the Damage</h2>
Once the frame is straightened out, you can start repairing the damage. If the frame is cracked or fractured, you’ll need to use a metal epoxy to fill in the gap. Make sure to read the instructions on the epoxy carefully and apply it properly. If the frame is bent or twisted, you can use a pair of pliers or an adjustable wrench to gently bend it back into shape.

<h2>Replace the Screws</h2>
Once you’ve repaired the damage, you’ll need to replace any missing screws. Make sure to use the same type of screws that were originally used. This will ensure that the frames stay in place and don’t come apart.

<h2>Attach the Lenses</h2>
Once the frame is repaired and the screws are replaced, you can reattach the lenses. Start by placing the lenses in the frame, making sure they’re properly aligned. Then use the screws to secure them in place. Make sure the screws are tight, but not overly tight, as this may damage the lenses.

<h2>Finishing Up</h2>
Once you’ve reattached the lenses, you’re almost done! Just give the frames a final inspection to make sure everything is in place and secure. If everything looks good, you can put them back on and enjoy your newly repaired metal glasses frames!
