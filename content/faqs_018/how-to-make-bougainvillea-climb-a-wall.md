<h2>Steps for Training Bougainvillea</h2>

<p>Once you have all the necessary supplies, you can begin training your Bougainvillea to climb a wall. The following steps will help you get started:</p>

<h3>1. Choose a Location</h3>

Make sure to attach the Bougainvillea at least 12 inches away from the wall to allow for growth. You can also use a trellis or other support structure to help keep the Bougainvillea upright.</p>

<h3>5. Prune and Fertilize</h3>

<p>Once the Bougainvillea is secured, you will need to prune it regularly. This will help promote healthy growth and prevent the plant from becoming overgrown. You should also fertilize the plant once or twice a month to provide the essential nutrients it needs to thrive.</p>
