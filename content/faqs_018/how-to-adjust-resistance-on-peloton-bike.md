<p>Peloton bikes are one of the most popular stationary exercise bikes on the market, and for good reason. Not only do they offer an intense, low-impact workout, but they also provide riders with an array of customization options. One of the most important customizations that a rider can make is adjusting the resistance level on the bike. This article will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to adjust the resistance on a Peloton bike. </p>

<h2>What Is Resistance On A Peloton Bike?</h2>

<p>Resistance on a Peloton bike is the amount of force the pedals need to be pushed with in order to move the bike. It is measured in watts and can be adjusted to make the ride easier or harder, depending on the user’s preference. Generally, higher resistance levels will produce a more intense workout and lower resistance levels will produce a less intense workout. </p>
