<p>John Deere riding mowers are powerful tools for keeping your lawn in perfect condition. To keep your machine operating properly, it is important to regularly inspect and replace the blades. Fortunately, changing mower blades on a John Deere riding mower is fairly straightforward and can be done in a few easy steps.</p>

<h2>Steps for Changing Blades on a John Deere Riding Mower</h2>

<p>The first step in changing the blades on your John Deere riding mower is to park the machine on a flat and level surface. Make sure the engine is completely off and that the blades are completely stopped. You should also engage the parking brake, turn off the fuel supply, and disconnect the spark plug to avoid any potential accidents.</p>

<p>Next, you will need to remove the mower deck from the machine. To do this, you will need to locate the deck lift lever and the deck height lever. Once you have located these two levers, you can disengage them and lift the mower deck off the machine. Make sure to lift the deck straight up, as any side-to-side motion could potentially damage the deck.</p>

<p>With the deck removed, you can now access the blades. To remove the blades, start by removing the blade bolts, which are located at the base of the blade. Be sure to use the right size wrench and a pair of gloves to protect your hands during this process. Once the blade bolts are removed, you can then lift the blades off the deck.</p>

<p>To install the new blades, start by placing the blades onto the deck. Be sure to place the blades in the same orientation as the old blades and make sure the cutting edges are facing the same direction. Once the blades are in place, you can then reinstall the blade bolts and tighten them securely.</p>

<p>Finally, you can re-install the mower deck on the machine. Make sure to engage the deck lift lever and the deck height lever and lower the deck onto the machine. Once the deck is securely in place, you can reconnect the spark plug, turn on the fuel supply, and engage the parking brake.</p>
