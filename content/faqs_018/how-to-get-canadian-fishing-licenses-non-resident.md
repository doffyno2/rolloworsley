Fishing is a favourite pastime of many Canadians, and it's no surprise that it's a popular activity for non-residents, too. After all, Canada has some of the most abundant and diverse fisheries in the world. Whether you're a seasoned angler or a beginner, you'll need to get a Canadian fishing license before you can legally fish in the country. Getting a Canadian fishing license as a non-resident isn't complicated, but there are a few things you should know before you start.

<h2>Where to Get a Canadian Fishing License</h2>

The first step to getting a Canadian fishing license is to find out who is responsible for issuing them in your area. In most provinces and territories, this is the provincial ministry or department responsible for fisheries. In Alberta, for instance, the Alberta Department of Fisheries and Oceans (AFDO) is the responsible body. In British Columbia, it's the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resource Operations.

In most areas, you can purchase a fishing license in person at a local fishing supply store, or by mail from the provincial ministry or department responsible. You can also purchase a license online from the ministry or department's website.

In some areas, you may also be able to purchase a fishing license from a third-party vendor, such as a sport-fishing organization or an outdoors outfitter. However, you should check with the local ministry or department responsible for fisheries to make sure that the third-party vendor you're buying from is authorized to issue Canadian fishing licenses.

<h2>Types of Canadian Fishing Licenses</h2>

Once you know where to get your fishing license, it's time to decide which type of license you need. Canadian fishing licenses come in a variety of types, depending on the type of fish you're trying to catch and where you plan to fish. 

The most common type of license is a general fishing license, which allows you to catch most types of fish in most areas. If you're planning to fish in a particular area, such as a lake or river, you may need a specific license for that area. 

In some provinces, such as British Columbia, you may need a separate license for each type of fish you want to catch. For instance, if you want to catch salmon, you'll need a salmon fishing license. If you want to catch trout, you'll need a trout fishing license. If you plan to catch multiple types of fish, you may need to purchase multiple licenses.

<h2>Cost of Canadian Fishing Licenses</h2>

The cost of a Canadian fishing license varies depending on the type of license and the province or territory in which you're fishing. Generally, general fishing licenses are the least expensive, while licenses for specific areas or types of fish are more costly. 

In Alberta, for instance, the cost of a general fishing license is $27.50 for a three-day license and $42.50 for a seven-day license. A salmon fishing license in British Columbia costs $34.50 for a three-day license and $67 for a seven-day license.

<h2>Requirements for Non-Residents</h2>

In addition to purchasing a fishing license, non-residents may also need to obtain an Outdoors Card before they can legally fish in Canada. An Outdoors Card is a provincial identification card that allows non-residents to fish in Canada. 

In some provinces, such as Alberta, non-residents may also need to obtain a fishing conservation stamp before they can legally fish in the province. A conservation stamp is a fee that helps to fund fisheries management and conservation efforts in the province. 

In Alberta, the cost of the Outdoors Card is $9.95, and the cost of the conservation stamp is $8.75. In British Columbia, the cost of the Outdoors Card is $10, and the cost of the conservation stamp is $6.
