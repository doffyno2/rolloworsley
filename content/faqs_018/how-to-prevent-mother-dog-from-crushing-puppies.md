If you have a pregnant dog and are worried about her accidentally crushing her puppies during delivery, then you are not alone. Many new dog owners are understandably concerned about this possibility and want to take the necessary steps to prevent it. Fortunately, there are some simple steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of a mother dog crushing her puppies during delivery. 

<h2>Ensure that the Mother Dog is Comfortable</h2>

The most important step in preventing a mother dog from crushing her puppies during delivery is making sure that she is as comfortable as possible. This means providing her with a safe, comfortable environment to give birth in, such as a large box or crate lined with blankets and towels. The area should also be well-ventilated and away from any direct sunlight or heat sources. 

<h2>Provide the Mother Dog with Plenty of Support</h2>

It is also important to ensure that the mother dog has plenty of support during delivery. This can include providing her with food, water, and a comfortable place to lie down. Additionally, you should be on hand to give her reassuring words and gentle petting throughout the birthing process. If you are worried that the mother dog may be too stressed, you can also contact a veterinarian for assistance. 

<h2>Be Prepared to Assist During Delivery</h2>

In some cases, dogs may need assistance during delivery. Therefore, it is important to be prepared to help if needed. This may involve gently removing the puppies from the mother's birth canal, clearing away the fluid and umbilical cord, and stimulating the puppies to start breathing. It is important to note that this should only be done when absolutely necessary and with the assistance of a veterinarian. 

<h2>Regularly Check on the Mother Dog and Puppies</h2>

Once the puppies are born, it is important to regularly check on the mother dog and her puppies.

Additionally, the mother dog should not be disturbed while she is resting, unless absolutely necessary.
