<p>The Shimano Acera rear derailleur is a great choice for those looking for a reliable and affordable drivetrain component. It's also a great way to upgrade from an older, more basic derailleur. Adjusting the rear derailleur on a Shimano Acera is a simple process, but it's important to understand the process and the components involved before attempting to make any adjustments. The following guide will walk you through the steps to ensure you have a perfectly adjusted Shimano Acera rear derailleur.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed for Adjustment</h2>

<p>Before you begin adjusting your Shimano Acera rear derailleur, make sure you have the necessary tools. You'll need a flathead screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers, and a set of Shimano-specific tools, such as the Shimano TL-RD10 tool. The TL-RD10 is designed specifically for adjusting Shimano rear derailleurs and is a must for any home mechanic.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Setting the High and Low Gears</h2>

<p>The first step in adjusting your Shimano Acera rear derailleur is to set the high and low gears. This is done by loosening the two limit screws on the derailleur. To do this, turn the screwdriver counterclockwise until the limit screws are loose. Once the screws are loose, you can adjust the limit screws to set the high and low gear limits. To do this, use the tension adjuster on the derailleur, and adjust it until the chain is running in the desired gears.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjusting the B-Tension Screw</h2>

<p>Once the high and low gear limits are set, it's time to adjust the B-tension screw. This screw is located on the back of the derailleur and is used to adjust the tension of the chain. To adjust the B-tension screw, turn it counterclockwise until the chain is slightly loose. Once the chain is slightly loose, you can adjust the B-tension screw until the chain is running in the desired gear.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Adjusting the Cable Tension</h2>

<p>The next step in adjusting your Shimano Acera rear derailleur is to adjust the cable tension. This is done by using the barrel adjuster on the derailleur. To adjust the cable tension, turn the barrel adjuster counterclockwise until the cable is slightly loose. Once the cable is slightly loose, you can adjust the barrel adjuster until the desired gear is achieved.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Adjusting the Indexing</h2>

<p>Once the cable tension and B-tension are set, it's time to adjust the indexing. This is done by adjusting the index adjustment screw on the derailleur. To do this, use the screwdriver to turn the screw counterclockwise until the desired gear is achieved. Once the desired gear is achieved, the index adjustment screw can be tightened until it is snug.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>Once the index adjustment screw is adjusted, it's time to make any final adjustments. This includes checking to make sure the chain is running smoothly and that the derailleur is not rubbing against any of the other components. If any rubbing is found, adjust the limit screws or cable tension as necessary. Once everything is running smoothly, your Shimano Acera rear derailleur is ready to go!</p>
