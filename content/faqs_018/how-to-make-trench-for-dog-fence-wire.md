How to Make Trench for Dog Fence Wire

Installing an underground dog fence isn't as difficult as it sounds. With the right tools and knowledge, you can create a professional-looking fence in no time. If you're looking to install a dog fence, one of the most important steps is to create a trench for the fence's wire. Here's how to do it.

<h2>Gather the Necessary Tools and Supplies</h2>
Before you begin, make sure you have all the necessary tools and supplies for the job. You'll need a shovel, a post-hole digger, a string line, and a measuring tape. You'll also need a trencher for the actual trench, which can be rented from your local hardware store. Other supplies include stakes to mark the trench line, a concrete saw for cutting through hard surfaces, and crushed gravel for filling in the trench.

<h2>Mark the Fence Line</h2>
Once you have all the necessary tools and supplies, the next step is to mark the fence line. Start by laying out the string line in a straight line along the perimeter of the area where the fence will be installed. Use the stakes to mark the line at each corner and along the straight sections of the line. Then, measure the distance between the stakes and mark the line with paint or chalk.

<h2>Dig the Trench</h2>
When you've marked the fence line, it's time to dig the trench. Start at one end of the line and use the post-hole digger to dig a trench that's about 6 inches wide and 8 inches deep. Keep in mind that you'll need to leave a gap of about 4 inches between the wire and the sides of the trench so that the wire can lay flat. As you dig, use the measuring tape to ensure that the trench is the same depth throughout.

<h2>Cut Through Hard Surfaces</h2>
If you're installing the fence on a hard surface, such as concrete or asphalt, you'll need to use a concrete saw to cut through the surface. This will allow you to dig a trench that's deep enough for the wire. Make sure you wear safety glasses when using the saw to protect your eyes from any flying debris.

<h2>Install the Wire</h2>
Once the trench is dug, it's time to install the wire. Start by laying the wire along the bottom of the trench and then use the shovel to backfill the trench with the crushed gravel. Make sure you pack the gravel tightly to ensure that the wire remains secure. 

<h2>Test the Fence</h2>
Finally, it's time to test the fence. Plug the transmitter into an electrical outlet and turn it on. Place the collar on your dog and turn it on. Then, walk your dog along the fence line and check for any areas where the fence isn't working correctly. If you find any weak spots, adjust the wire or add more gravel to the trench to ensure that it's secure.
