<p>When it comes to outdoor cooking, the Blackstone Griddle is the perfect tool for the job. It’s incredibly versatile, allowing you to cook a wide variety of food, from pancakes to steaks. But with any outdoor cooking tool, there’s one thing that you’ll have to do after each use: cleaning the griddle. It’s important to properly clean the griddle after each use to prevent any buildup of food particles and grease, which can lead to bacteria growth. Cleaning a Blackstone Griddle is easy and doesn’t take long. Here’s how to do it.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Gather Your Cleaning Supplies</h2>

<p>Before you begin cleaning your Blackstone Griddle, you’ll need to gather the right supplies. You’ll need a few sponges, dish soap, warm water, a stiff brush, and a cloth. It’s also a good idea to have a pair of kitchen gloves handy, as the griddle will be hot to the touch. Once you have everything you need, you’re ready to begin.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove Any Residue and Grease</h2>

<p>Once your griddle is cool enough to touch, you’ll want to remove any food residue and grease. To do this, you’ll need to use a stiff brush and soapy water. Scrub the griddle with the brush to loosen any food particles, then wipe it down with a wet cloth. If there’s any caked-on grease, you can use a degreaser to help loosen it up, then scrub it off with the brush.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Rinse and Dry</h2>

<p>Once you’ve removed all the food particles and grease, you’ll want to rinse the griddle with clean water. Use a damp cloth to wipe down the griddle, then dry it off with a clean towel. Make sure to dry the griddle thoroughly, as any residual moisture can lead to rusting.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Season the Griddle</h2>

<p>Once the griddle is dry, you’ll want to season it. This will help protect the griddle from rust and make it easier to clean next time. To season the griddle, you’ll need to heat it up, then brush on a thin layer of oil. You’ll want to use a high-heat oil, such as avocado oil or canola oil, as these will withstand the heat better. Once the oil is on the griddle, spread it out with a paper towel. Then, turn off the heat and let the griddle cool down.</p>
