<p>Having a bike pump handy is essential for any cyclist. Not only will it help you get back on the road in the case of a flat tire, but it can also help you to keep your tires properly inflated. Unfortunately, bike pumps can break, leaving you with a potentially expensive repair bill.

<h2>Tools You’ll Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, make sure you have all the tools you’ll need for the job. You’ll need a few basic tools, such as a Phillips head screwdriver, a flathead screwdriver, pliers, and a wrench. A pair of safety glasses is also a good idea.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Identify the Problem</h2>

<p>The first step in fixing a bike pump is to identify the problem. Is the pump leaking air? Is the handle not working properly? Is the pump unable to create enough pressure? Knowing the exact problem will help you determine the best solution.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Disassemble the Pump</h2>

<p>Once you’ve identified the problem, it’s time to disassemble the pump. Start by removing the handle and unscrewing the pump head. Be sure to keep track of all the parts as you disassemble them. This will make it easier to reassemble the pump when you’re done.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Inspect the Parts</h2>

<p>Once you’ve disassembled the pump, inspect each part for damage. Look for cracks, broken parts, and worn or corroded surfaces. If any of the parts are damaged, you’ll need to replace them.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Clean the Parts</h2>

<p>Once you’ve identified any damaged parts, it’s time to clean the remaining parts. Use a rag or brush to remove any dirt or debris. If there are any corroded surfaces, use a metal polish to remove them. Be sure to clean all the parts thoroughly before reassembling the pump.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Reassemble the Pump</h2>

<p>Once all the parts are clean, you can begin to reassemble the pump. Start by replacing any damaged parts. Then, carefully reattach all the parts in the correct order. Make sure to use the correct tools for each part and tighten all the screws securely.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Test the Pump</h2>

<p>Once you’ve reassembled the pump, it’s time to test it. Connect the pump to a tire and start pumping. If the pump works properly, you’re done. If not, you may need to adjust or replace some of the parts.</p>
