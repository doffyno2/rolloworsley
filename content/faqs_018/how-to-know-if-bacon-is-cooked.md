<p>Bacon is an incredibly delicious and savory food, but if it's not cooked properly, it won't be as tasty. Knowing how to properly cook bacon is key to creating a delicious meal. Here, we'll discuss how to know if bacon is cooked and how to cook it perfectly every time.</p>

<h2>The Different Types of Bacon</h2>

<p>Before we discuss how to know if bacon is cooked, it's important to understand the different types of bacon. There are three main types of bacon: streaky, back, and unsmoked. Streaky bacon is the most popular variety and is made from fatty pork belly. Back bacon is made from the loin of the pig, and is leaner and less fatty than streaky bacon. Unsmoked bacon is bacon that has not been cured or smoked, and is usually used in dishes like quiche or omelettes.</p>

<h2>How to Know if Bacon is Cooked</h2>

<p>When it comes to knowing if bacon is cooked, there are a few signs to look for. First, you should look for color. Bacon should be a golden brown color. If it's still pale, it's not cooked enough. Another thing to look for is crispness. Bacon should be crisp and crunchy when it's done. If it's still soft or limp, it's not done. Lastly, you should also look for fat. If the bacon is still fatty, it needs to be cooked longer.</p>

<h2>Tips for Perfectly Cooked Bacon Every Time</h2>

<p>Now that we know how to know if bacon is cooked, let's discuss some tips on how to make sure that you get perfectly cooked bacon every time. First, you should always start with a cold pan.
