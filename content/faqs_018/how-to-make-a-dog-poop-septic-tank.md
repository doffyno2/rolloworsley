<h2>What is a Septic Tank?</h2>

A septic tank is a type of wastewater treatment system that is used to process wastewater from homes, businesses, and other structures. It is a closed system that consists of a tank and a drain field. The tank is buried in the ground and collects wastewater from the home or business. The wastewater is then treated by a combination of anaerobic bacteria and aerobic bacteria, which break down the organic matter in the wastewater and make it safe for discharge into the environment.
