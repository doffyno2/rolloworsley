We all know that the weather can be unpredictable, and when the temperatures start to heat up, it can be hard to know what to wear. When the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or higher, it's time to find the right pieces to keep you cool and comfortable. In this article, we'll show you how to dress in 30 degree weather so you can stay cool and look great at the same time.

<h2>Understand the Temperature</h2>

When the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or higher, the weather is considered hot. This means that you should wear light, breathable fabrics that will help keep you cool. Cotton, linen, and rayon are all great choices for hot days. Avoid wearing heavy fabrics like wool or corduroy, as they can make you feel even hotter.

<h2>Choose Light Colors</h2>

Dark colors absorb heat, so try to stick with light colors like white, beige, light blue, and pink. Lighter colors will help reflect the sun's rays, keeping you cooler. If you want to add a pop of color to your outfit, opt for bright colors like red, yellow, and orange.

<h2>Choose Lightweight Fabrics</h2>

When the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or higher, you should avoid wearing heavy fabrics like denim or wool. Opt for lightweight fabrics like cotton, linen, and rayon, which will help keep you cool and comfortable. Avoid wearing synthetic fabrics like polyester or nylon, as they can make you feel even hotter.

<h2>Stay Away from Skinny Jeans and Tights</h2>

Skinny jeans and tights can be uncomfortable when the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or higher. Instead, opt for loose-fitting trousers or shorts that will allow your skin to breathe. If you want to wear jeans, choose a pair with a relaxed fit and a lightweight fabric.

<h2>Pick the Right Shoes</h2>

When the weather is hot, it's important to choose the right shoes. Avoid wearing boots or closed-toe shoes, as they can make your feet feel even hotter. Instead, opt for sandals or open-toe shoes that will let your feet breathe. If you have to wear closed-toe shoes, make sure they're made of a lightweight fabric like canvas or leather.

<h2>Layer Your Clothing</h2>

Layering your clothing is a great way to stay cool in hot weather. Start with a lightweight tank top or t-shirt, then add a lightweight cardigan or blazer for extra coverage. If it gets too hot, you can always take off the extra layers and stay cool.

<h2>Accessorize with a Hat</h2>

A hat is a great way to keep the sun off your face and protect your skin from sunburn. Choose a lightweight hat that won't make you feel too hot, like a straw hat or a wide-brimmed sun hat.

<h2>Protect Your Skin</h2>

When the temperature is 30 degrees Celsius or higher, it's important to protect your skin from the sun. Wear a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, and reapply it every two hours. Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from the sun's harmful UV rays.

<h2>Stay Hydrated</h2>

It's important to stay hydrated when the temperature is high. Carry a reusable water bottle with you and make sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. Avoid drinking sugary drinks like soda or juice, as they can make you feel even hotter.
