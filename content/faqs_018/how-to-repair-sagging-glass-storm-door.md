Insert the new screws and tighten them with a Phillips screwdriver. Make sure to check the door with the level to make sure the hinges are even.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Install a New Door</h2>

<p>If the door is badly worn or damaged, it may be best to replace it. You can purchase a new storm door from your local home improvement store.
