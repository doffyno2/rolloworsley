<p>Squirrels are some of the most sought-after game animals in the United States. They are relatively easy to hunt and can provide a great bounty of meat for the table. However, to successfully hunt squirrels, one must understand the basics of baiting them. This article will discuss the different methods of baiting squirrels, the best types of baits to use, and the best locations for setting up bait stations.</p>

<h2>What is Baiting?</h2>

<p>Baiting is the practice of attracting animals to a specific area by providing them with food. This can be done by placing food in an area where it is easy for animals to find and access. This can be done with a variety of food items, such as nuts, fruits, and grains. In the case of squirrels, baiting them can be done with a variety of foods. The best baits are high in fat, such as peanut butter, nuts, and dried fruits.</p>

<h2>Where to Place Bait Stations</h2>

<p>When baiting squirrels, it is important to place bait stations in areas where they are likely to frequent. This includes near trees, bushes, and other areas where they are likely to be found. It is important to set up bait stations in areas where other animals, such as cats and dogs, are not likely to find them. This will help ensure that the bait does not get stolen or contaminated.</p>

<p>It is also important to make sure that the bait stations are placed in areas that are not easily visible from a distance. This will help to ensure that the bait is only seen by the squirrels and not other animals. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the bait stations are placed in areas where the squirrels can safely access them.</p>

Overripe fruit can attract other animals, such as birds, and can quickly spoil if left out in the open.
