This guide will provide you with all the information you need to move a washing machine without a dolly.</p>

<h2>Gather the Right Materials</h2>

<p>The first step in moving your washing machine without a dolly is to prepare the washing machine. You will need to make sure that the washing machine is turned off and unplugged from the wall. You should also make sure that the washing machine is completely empty. Once you have taken these steps, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Place the Washing Machine on a Flat Surface</h2>

<p>Once the washing machine is prepared, you can place it on a flat surface. You can use a blanket or towel to prevent the washing machine from sliding around as you move it. You should also make sure that the surface is sturdy enough to support the weight of the washing machine.</p>

Make sure that you are all moving at the same pace and that the washing machine is not slipping out of your hands. Once the washing machine is in its new location, you can set it down and make sure it is level.</p>
