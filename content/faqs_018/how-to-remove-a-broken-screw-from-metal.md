<h2>Step-by-Step Guide on How to Remove a Broken Screw from Metal</h2>

Once you have all the necessary tools and supplies, it's time to start removing the broken screw from metal. Here's a step-by-step guide that will help you get the job done:

<h3>1. Identify the Problem</h3>

The first step in removing a broken screw from metal is to identify the problem. Check the screw to determine if it is loose, stuck, or completely broken off. If it is loose, you may be able to remove it with a screwdriver or drill bit. If it is stuck, you may need to use a pair of pliers or vice grips to loosen it. And if it is completely broken off, you'll need to use a hacksaw or screw extractor to remove it.

<h3>2. Apply Penetrating Oil</h3>

If the screw is stuck, you'll need to apply some penetrating oil to help loosen it. You can buy penetrating oil at your local hardware store. Apply a few drops of the oil to the screw and let it sit for about 10 minutes before attempting to remove it.

<h3>3. Remove the Screw</h3>

Once the penetrating oil has had a chance to work its magic, you can try to remove the screw. Use a screwdriver or drill bit to loosen the screw. If the screw is still stuck, try using a pair of pliers or vice grips. If the screw is still stuck, you may need to use a hacksaw or screw extractor to remove it.

<h3>4. Clean the Hole</h3>

Once the screw has been removed, you'll need to clean the hole. Use a piece of steel wool or sandpaper to remove any rust or debris from the hole. Then use a hole saw to enlarge the hole if needed.

<h3>5. Insert a New Screw</h3>

Once the hole has been cleaned, you can insert a new screw. Use a hammer to tap the new screw into place until it is secure.
