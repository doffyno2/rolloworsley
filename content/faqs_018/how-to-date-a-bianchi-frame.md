<p>If you’re a cyclist, you may be familiar with Bianchi bicycles. Bianchi is one of the oldest bicycle companies in the world and they’ve been making some of the best bikes for over 130 years. But, if you own a Bianchi or are looking to buy one, you may want to know the age of the frame. Determining the age of a Bianchi frame can be a bit tricky, but there are a few ways you can do it.</p>

<h2>Check the Serial Number</h2>

<p>The most reliable way to date a Bianchi frame is to look for a serial number. All Bianchi frames made since the late 1970s will have a serial number stamped on the bottom bracket. This number can usually be found on the drive side of the bottom bracket. It should be a seven or eight digit number with the first four or five digits representing the year the frame was made.</p>

<p>For example, a serial number that starts with “9305” would indicate that the frame was made in 1993. The remaining digits will indicate the month and the specific model of the frame. If the serial number is missing, you may still be able to get an approximate age of the frame by looking at the components.</p>

<h2>Inspect the Components</h2>

<p>If the serial number is missing, you can still get an approximate age of the frame by looking at the components. Older Bianchi frames will typically have down tube shifters, steel wheels, and a quill stem. If the frame has caliper brakes and a threadless stem, it’s likely from the 1990s or later. If the frame has cantilever brakes and a threaded fork, it’s likely from the 1980s. If the frame has center-pull brakes and a threaded fork, it’s likely from the 1970s.</p>

<p>The components can also tell you about the model of the frame. For example, if the frame has Shimano 105 components, it’s likely an entry-level road bike. If it has Campagnolo components, it’s likely a higher-end road bike. The components can also tell you the approximate age of the frame. For example, if the frame has Shimano 600 components, it’s likely from the late 1980s. If it has Shimano 105 components, it’s likely from the mid-1990s.</p>

<h2>Contact Bianchi</h2>

<p>If you’re still unsure of the age of your Bianchi frame, you can always contact Bianchi directly. They can often provide information on the frame based on the serial number or other identifying information. They may also be able to provide information on the options and upgrades available for your particular frame.</p>
