If you are not careful, you can end up hitting the garage door frame, causing damage to yourself or your car. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to avoid this problem.</p>

<h2>Know Your Garage Door Size</h2>

<p>Before you can begin to avoid hitting the garage door frame, you need to understand the size of your garage door. Most garage doors measure seven to eight feet wide and seven to eight feet tall. If you know the size of your garage door, you can adjust your driving habits to ensure you don’t hit the frame.</p>

<p>Your garage door likely has sensors that detect when an object is in the way of the door. These sensors help protect you and your car from hitting the door frame. Make sure these sensors are working properly so that the garage door won’t close if something is in the way.</p>

<h2>Pay Attention To Your Surroundings</h2>

<p>When you are backing out of the garage, make sure to pay attention to your surroundings. Look for any obstructions, such as children or animals, that may be in the way. If you see something in the way, stop and make sure it is clear before continuing.</p>

<h2>Check Your Lights</h2>

<p>If your garage door has lights, make sure they are working properly. Lights can help you see if there is something in the way of the door. If the light is not working, you may not be able to see if something is in the way, resulting in you hitting the door frame.</p>

<h2>Inspect The Door Regularly</h2>
