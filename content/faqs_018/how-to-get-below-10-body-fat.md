<p>In todayâ€™s society, having a slim, toned body is the goal of many people. But, in order to achieve the truly slim and toned body, it takes hard work and dedication. Achieving and maintaining a body fat percentage of 10% or less is an accomplishment that can be achieved with the right focus and determination.</p>

<h2>What is Body Fat?</h2>

<p>Body fat is the percentage of fat that is stored in the body in comparison to the amount of lean body mass. Lean body mass is the amount of fat-free tissue found in the body. This includes muscle, bone, organs, skin, and water. A healthy body fat percentage for a person is between 18-25%, but for a truly toned and athletic look, a body fat percentage of 10% or less is ideal.</p>

<h2>Factors that Influence Body Fat Percentage</h2>

<p>There are many factors that can influence a person's body fat percentage. These include age, gender, genetics, and lifestyle choices. Genetics can play a large role in body fat percentage, as some people are naturally more prone to carrying more fat. Age can also play a role, as metabolism tends to slow with age, making it more difficult to maintain a low body fat percentage. Additionally, hormones can play a role in body fat storage, often influencing where fat is stored. For example, women tend to store more fat in their hips and thighs than men.</p>

<h2>How to Achieve a Low Body Fat Percentage</h2>

<p>Achieving a low body fat percentage requires a combination of diet and exercise. In order to lose fat, a person needs to eat fewer calories than they burn. This means eating a healthy, balanced diet that is low in fat and high in lean proteins and complex carbohydrates. Eating smaller meals more frequently can also help to boost metabolism and encourage fat loss. Additionally, regular exercise is essential for achieving a low body fat percentage. A combination of strength training and cardio activities can help to burn calories and tone muscle, leading to a lean and toned body.</p>

<h2>Tips for Maintaining a Low Body Fat Percentage</h2>

<p>Once a person has achieved a low body fat percentage, it is important to maintain it. This can be done through a combination of diet and exercise. Eating a healthy, balanced diet filled with whole foods is essential for maintaining a low body fat percentage. Additionally, exercise should still be a part of the routine in order to keep the muscles toned and prevent fat storage. Additionally, getting enough rest is essential for maintaining a low body fat percentage, as this helps to keep the metabolism running smoothly.</p>
