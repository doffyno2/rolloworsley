<p>If you own a Ford Explorer 2006 model, you may have noticed that a dashboard light appears every so often that says “Maintenance Required.” This light is a reminder to have your vehicle serviced periodically, as recommended by Ford. However, if you have already performed the necessary maintenance, the light can be reset so that it does not continue to flash. In this article, we will show you how to reset the maintenance required light on a Ford Explorer 2006.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed to Reset the Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>The only tool that is required to reset the maintenance light on a Ford Explorer 2006 is an OBD2 scanner. This is a device that is used to read diagnostic trouble codes from the computer in your vehicle. This device can be purchased from any automotive parts store. You may also be able to borrow one from a friend or family member.</p>

<h2>Steps to Reset the Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>Once you have an OBD2 scanner, you can reset the maintenance light on a Ford Explorer 2006. The steps are as follows:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Connect the OBD2 Scanner</h3>

<p>The first step is to connect the OBD2 scanner to the vehicle. This can be done by plugging the device into the port located underneath the dashboard on the driver’s side of the vehicle. Once the device is plugged in, the OBD2 scanner will be able to read the codes from the vehicle’s computer.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Read the Codes</h3>

<p>The next step is to read the codes from the vehicle’s computer. The OBD2 scanner will display the codes that are currently stored in the computer. It is important to note that some of these codes may not be related to the maintenance light. Be sure to read all of the codes to ensure that the maintenance light is the only code that is being displayed.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Clear the Codes</h3>

<p>Once you have read all of the codes from the vehicle’s computer, it is time to clear the codes. This can be done by pressing the “Clear” button on the OBD2 scanner. This will clear all of the codes from the vehicle’s computer, including the code for the maintenance light.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Test the Reset</h3>

<p>The final step is to test the reset. Start the vehicle and check the dashboard to make sure that the maintenance light is no longer illuminated. If the light is still on, repeat the steps above until the light is off. Once the light is off, the reset is complete.</p>
