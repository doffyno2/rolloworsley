<p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language used to create web pages and other documents. HTML provides a convenient way to manipulate images, whether they are uploaded to a website or downloaded from the Internet. In this guide, we'll show you how to use HTML to change the size of an image.</p>

<h2>What Is Image Size?</h2>

<p>Image size is the physical dimensions of an image, measured in pixels. The size of an image can be changed by either increasing or decreasing the number of pixels it contains. When an image is enlarged, it becomes more blurry and pixelated, while when it is reduced in size, it becomes more sharp and clear. Changing the size of an image can be done in a few different ways.</p>

<h2>How to Change Image Size HTML</h2>

<p>The HTML <img> tag is used to display an image on a web page. This tag can also be used to change the size of an image. By setting the width and height attributes of the <img> tag, you can specify the size of an image.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Let’s say you have an image that is 500 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall. To change the size of this image, you would set the width and height attributes of the <img> tag like this:</p>

<p><img src="example.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></p>

<p>By setting the width and height attributes to 300 and 200 respectively, the image will be resized to 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall.</p>

<h3>Adding a Max-Width Attribute:</h3>

<p>You can also add a max-width attribute to the <img> tag to set a maximum width for the image. This can be useful if you want to ensure that an image doesn’t exceed a certain size. For example, if you wanted to make sure an image doesn’t exceed 300 pixels wide, you could do this:</p>

<p><img src="example.jpg" width="300" height="200" max-width="300" /></p>

<h2>Using CSS to Change Image Size</h2>

<p>You can also use CSS to change the size of an image. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style web pages and other documents. CSS provides a convenient way to manipulate the size of an image.</p>

<h3>Example:</h3>

<p>Let’s say you have an image that is 500 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall. To change the size of this image, you would set the width and height properties of the image like this:</p>

<p>img {<br>
  width: 300px;<br>
  height: 200px;<br>
}</p>

<p>By setting the width and height properties to 300 and 200 respectively, the image will be resized to 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall.</p>

<h3>Adding a Max-Width Property:</h3>

<p>You can also add a max-width property to the image to set a maximum width for the image. This can be useful if you want to ensure that an image doesn’t exceed a certain size. For example, if you wanted to make sure an image doesn’t exceed 300 pixels wide, you could do this:</p>

<p>img {<br>
  width: 300px;<br>
  height: 200px;<br>
  max-width: 300px;<br>
}</p>
