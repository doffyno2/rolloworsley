<p>Mulch is a great way to add texture, color and nutrients to your garden. Dogs, however, are not so fond of it and can be tempted to eat it. Eating mulch can be dangerous for dogs, as it can lead to serious health problems. In this article, we'll explain how to keep your dog away from mulch and help you prevent your pooch from getting sick.</p>

<h2>Why Dogs Eat Mulch</h2>

<p>Dogs often eat mulch because it looks and smells good to them. The smell of mulched wood chips may remind them of other treats theyâ€™ve eaten in the past, and the texture of the mulch may make it seem like an appealing snack. Dogs may also be attracted to the smell of the fertilizer mixed in with the mulch. Additionally, some dogs may be drawn to the mulch because it is a new and exciting thing in their environment.</p>

<h2>Dangers of Eating Mulch</h2>

<p>Eating mulch can be dangerous for dogs. The biggest risk is the potential for intestinal blockage. Mulch is made up of small pieces of wood and other materials that are not easily digested. If a dog eats enough of it, the pieces can get stuck in the intestines and cause an obstruction. This can be life-threatening and requires immediate veterinary attention.</p> 

<p>In addition to the risk of blockage, some types of mulch contain chemicals that can be toxic to dogs. Fertilizer, pesticides, and herbicides can all be present in mulch, and can be dangerous if ingested. Ingesting large amounts of mulch can also cause digestive upset and vomiting.</p>

If your yard is not fenced, you may need to take extra precautions. Make sure to keep your dog on a leash when they are outside, and supervise them closely while they are in the yard.</p>

<p>You can also use a variety of deterrents to keep your dog away from the mulch. These can include motion-activated sprinklers, water guns, and even certain smells that your dog finds unpleasant. You can also try covering the mulch with a smell that your dog does not like, such as cayenne pepper or lemon juice.</p>
