<p>If you own a Kenmore washing machine, you know the importance of keeping it running smoothly. But when your washing machine starts to leak, it can be a stressful situation for any homeowner. Fortunately, there are several steps you can take to repair a leaking Kenmore washing machine. Read on to learn more.</p>

<h2>Why Is My Kenmore Washing Machine Leaking?</h2>

<p>There are several potential causes for a leaking washing machine. The most common causes are a faulty water inlet valve, broken hose, worn out gasket, or clogged drain pump. It's important to identify the source of the leak before attempting any repairs.</p>

<h2>Diagnosing the Problem</h2>

<p>The first step in diagnosing a leak is to locate the source of the problem. Most leaks will occur at the back of the machine, near the water inlet valve or hoses. If the machine is leaking from the front, it's likely due to a clogged drain pump. If the machine is not draining properly, it can cause water to back up and overflow, which can lead to leaking.</p>

<p>Once you have located the source of the leak, it's time to determine the cause. If the leak is coming from the water inlet valve, it could be due to a faulty valve or worn out gasket. If the leak is coming from the hose, it could be due to a crack or puncture in the hose. If the leak is coming from the drain pump, it could be due to a clog or blockage in the pump.</p>

<h2>Repairing the Leak</h2>

<p>Once you have identified the cause of the leak, you can begin to repair it. If the leak is coming from the water inlet valve, you will need to replace the valve or gasket. If the leak is coming from the hose, you will need to replace the hose. If the leak is coming from the drain pump, you will need to remove the pump and clear any blockages or clogs.</p>

<p>When replacing the water inlet valve or gasket, make sure to use a genuine Kenmore replacement part. It's also important to turn off the water supply before attempting any repairs. This will ensure that no water is flowing through the machine while you're working on it.</p>

<h2>Preventing Future Leaks</h2>

<p>Once you have repaired the leak, it's important to take steps to prevent future leaks. Check the hoses and water inlet valve on a regular basis for signs of wear and tear. Replace any hoses that are cracked or punctured. Keep the drain pump clean and clear of any blockages or clogs. Finally, make sure the machine is level and not tilted in any direction.</p>
