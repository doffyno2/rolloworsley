<p>Moving abroad is an exciting and sometimes intimidating process. No matter where you are moving, it’s important to keep your US phone number so you don’t miss out on important calls and messages. But how can you keep your US phone number when you’re moving abroad?</p>

<p>In this article, we’ll cover the steps you need to take to keep your US phone number when moving abroad. We’ll also discuss some of the benefits of keeping your US phone number, and the best services to use if you’re looking to keep your US phone number when you move.</p>

<h2>Why Keep Your US Phone Number When Moving Abroad?</h2>

<p>There are many reasons why you may want to keep your US phone number when moving abroad. Perhaps the most important reason is that it gives you a sense of familiarity and continuity. By keeping your US phone number, you’ll still be able to receive calls from your family and friends in the US. This can be especially beneficial if you’re moving to a completely different country.</p>

<p>In addition, keeping your US phone number can be a great way to maintain your professional reputation. If you’re a freelancer or small business owner, your clients may still want to reach you on the same number. This can help you maintain relationships with important clients and ensure that you remain in contact with potential customers.</p>

<h2>How to Keep Your US Phone Number When Moving Abroad</h2>

<p>Fortunately, there are a few different ways to keep your US phone number when moving abroad. Here, we’ll cover some of the most popular methods.</p>

<h3>1. Roaming Services</h3>

<p>The first option is to use a roaming service. Roaming services allow you to use your US phone number in another country. This is usually done by renting a SIM card that is compatible with your phone in the country you are moving to. You can then use your US phone number as usual.</p>

<p>The downside to this method is that it can be expensive. Roaming charges can add up quickly, so it’s important to carefully consider the costs before you decide to use a roaming service.</p>

<h3>2. Virtual Phone Numbers</h3>

<p>Another option is to use a virtual phone number. Virtual phone numbers are phone numbers that are linked to a third-party service such as Skype or Google Voice. These services allow you to use your US phone number, even if you’re not in the US. This is a great option for those who don’t want to pay for roaming charges.</p>

<p>The downside to this method is that it can be confusing to set up and use. You may need to sign up for a third-party service and configure the settings to make sure your US phone number is working properly.</p>

<h3>3. VoIP Services</h3>

<p>Finally, you can use a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) service. VoIP services allow you to make and receive calls over the internet. This is a great option if you’re looking for an affordable way to keep your US phone number when moving abroad.</p>

<p>The downside to this method is that it requires a reliable internet connection. If you’re moving to an area with poor internet service, this may not be the best option for you.</p>
