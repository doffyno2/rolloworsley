It's important to know your Lyft passenger rating. You can check your rating to see what other riders think of you and make sure you're providing the best experience you can for your fellow passengers. This guide will show you how to check your Lyft passenger rating and how you can use the feedback to become a better rider.

<h2>What Is a Lyft Passenger Rating?</h2>

Your Lyft passenger rating is a numeric score between 1 and 5 that other riders can leave you after a ride. This rating is based on their experience with you and how courteous, respectful, and helpful you were.

<h2>How Do You Check Your Lyft Passenger Rating?</h2>

You can check your Lyft passenger rating by logging into your Lyft account. Once you're logged in, select the “My Riders” tab and scroll down to the “Ratings” section. Here, you’ll see your overall rating and the number of ratings you have received. You can also see your ratings from the past week, month, and all-time.

<h2>What Is a Good Rating on Lyft?</h2>

A good rating on Lyft is 4.5 or higher. Anything below 4.5 is considered below average, and you may need to work on improving your rating if you want to stay in good standing with Lyft.
