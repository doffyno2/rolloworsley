<p>Plastic retainers, also known as orthodontic retainers, are used to keep your teeth in the same position after you have had orthodontic treatment. They are made out of a clear acrylic material and can be easily damaged if not cared for properly. If your plastic retainer has been damaged, it is important to take the necessary steps to repair it. In this article, we will discuss the steps you can take to repair your plastic retainer.</p>

<h2>What Is a Retainer?</h2>

<p>A retainer is an orthodontic device used to keep your teeth in the same position after you have had orthodontic treatment. The retainer is usually made out of a clear acrylic material and is very delicate. It is important to take extra care when handling and cleaning your retainer.</p>

<h2>What Can I Do If My Retainer Is Damaged?</h2>

<h2>Steps to Repair Your Retainer</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Clean Your Retainer</h3>

<p>Before attempting to repair your retainer, it is important to clean it with a mild soap and warm water.
