<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Repairing Cracked Side Skirts</h2>

<p>Now that you have the tools you need, you can begin the repair process. Follow these steps to repair your cracked side skirts: </p>

<ol>
  <li>Clean the area around the crack with a clean rag. Make sure the area is free of dirt, debris and any other contaminants.</li>
  <li>Sand down the area around the crack with sandpaper. Be sure to use a fine grit sandpaper to avoid damaging the area further.</li>
  <li>Apply a layer of masking tape to the area around the crack. This will help keep the filler material in place while it dries.</li>
  <li>Using a putty knife, apply a generous amount of filler material to the crack. Make sure to fill the crack completely, and then smooth it down with the putty knife. Allow the filler material to dry for at least 24 hours.</li>
  <li>Once the filler material is dry, sand it down with a fine grit sandpaper. Be sure to sand the filler material until it is level with the rest of the side skirt.</li>
  <li>Apply primer to the area around the crack. This will help the paint adhere to the side skirt.</li>
  <li>Using a paintbrush, apply a layer of paint to the area around the crack. Allow the paint to dry for at least 24 hours.</li>
  <li>Once the paint has dried, apply a layer of clear coat to the area. This will help protect the paint from further damage.</li>

<h2>Tips for Repairing Cracked Side Skirts</h2>

<p>Repairing cracked side skirts can be a tricky process, even for experienced mechanics. To make sure you get the best results possible, here are some helpful tips:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be sure to use a fine grit sandpaper when sanding down the area around the crack. If you use a coarse grit sandpaper, you could end up damaging the side skirt further.</li>
