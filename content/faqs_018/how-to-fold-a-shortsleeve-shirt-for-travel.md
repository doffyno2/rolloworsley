When packing for a trip, it is essential to save as much space as possible. The goal is to fit everything into a suitcase or a backpack but still have room for souvenirs and gifts that you might buy during the journey. One of the most important items you will need to pack is a shirt, and learning how to fold a short-sleeve shirt for travel can help you save much-needed space.

<h2>Steps to Fold a Short-sleeve Shirt for Travel</h2>

Folding a short-sleeve shirt for travel is a simple process that can help you save space in your suitcase or backpack. Here are the steps you need to take:

<h3>Step 1: Lay the Shirt Flat</h3>

Start by laying the shirt flat on a clean, flat surface. Make sure the shirt is completely unfolded and that all the buttons and collars are laying flat.

<h3>Step 2: Fold in the Sleeves</h3>

Take one sleeve in each hand and fold them in towards the center of the shirt. Make sure to keep the edges of the sleeve aligned with the edges of the shirt.

<h3>Step 3: Fold in Half</h3>

Once the sleeves are folded in, fold the shirt in half by bringing the bottom of the shirt up to the top. Make sure to line up the edges of the shirt as you fold.

<h3>Step 4: Roll the Shirt</h3>

Start at one end of the shirt and roll it up. Keep the edges of the shirt aligned as you roll and make sure to tuck in any loose fabric.

<h3>Step 5: Secure with a Rubber Band</h3>

Once the shirt is rolled up, secure it with a rubber band or a hair tie. Make sure the band is tight enough to keep the shirt rolled up without being too tight.
