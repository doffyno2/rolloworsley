<p>If you’ve ever owned an Andersen window combination, you know how difficult it can be to repair the screen. Andersen windows, which combine a window and a screen, are a popular choice among homeowners, as they provide both security and ventilation. Unfortunately, due to their design, repairing the screen portion of the window can be a tricky endeavor. Luckily, we have some tips to help you repair your Andersen window combination. </p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you begin the repair process, make sure you have the following tools handy: </p>

<ul>
  <li>Replacement screen material</li>
  <li>Utility knife</li>
  <li>Scissors</li>
  <li>Tape measure</li>
  <li>Staple gun</li>
  <li>Screen spline</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Measure the Screen </h2>

<p>Using your tape measure, measure the exact dimensions of the screen. You will use this measurement to cut the replacement screen material to size. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Cut the Screen </h2>

<p>Lay the replacement screen material on a flat surface and use your utility knife to cut it to the size of the screen. Make sure the screen is cut to size accurately; otherwise, it won’t fit properly. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Install the Screen </h2>

<p>Now it’s time to install the replacement screen. First, place the screen over the window and secure it in place using the staple gun. Next, use the screen spline to secure the screen in place. Start at one corner and work your way around the perimeter of the window, pressing the spline into the frame. Once you’ve gone all the way around, use your scissors to trim off any excess material. </p>

<h2>Step 4: Check for Air Leaks </h2>

<p>Once you’ve finished installing the replacement screen, open and close the window to make sure it is functioning properly. Check for air leaks around the perimeter of the window; if you find any, use your utility knife to make any necessary adjustments. </p>
