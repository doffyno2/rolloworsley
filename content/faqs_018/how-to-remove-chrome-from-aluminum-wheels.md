How to Remove Chrome from Aluminum Wheels

One of the most popular wheel designs for cars and trucks is chrome-plated aluminum wheels. Chrome plating is a process that adds a layer of chrome to the wheel, giving it a shiny and durable finish. While chrome wheels are attractive, they are prone to damage from the elements and frequent use. Whether you want to restore the wheel to its original look or upgrade to another wheel finish, removing the chrome plating from your aluminum wheel is a relatively easy process.



In order to remove chrome plating from your aluminum wheel, you'll need the following materials:

• Safety goggles
• Work gloves
• Mask
• Plastic sheeting
• Grit sandpaper (80-320 grit)
• Buffing wheel
• Steel wool
• Chrome removal solution 
• Soft cloths
• Wax



Before you begin, be sure to wear the appropriate safety gear. Goggles and gloves are a must, and a mask should also be worn to protect you from any fumes. You should also cover nearby surfaces with plastic sheeting to protect them from metal filings, dust, and other debris.



Once you have your safety gear on, you can start sanding. Start with a coarse grit sandpaper (80-120 grit) and sand the wheel in a circular motion. Make sure to cover the entire wheel evenly and be sure to sand away any rust or corrosion. Once you are finished, wipe away any dust and debris and move on to the next step.



Attach a buffing wheel to an electric drill and set it to a low setting. Apply a buffing compound to the wheel and gently buff the wheel in a circular motion. This will help to remove the chrome plating and any remaining rust or corrosion.



After buffing the wheel, switch to a steel wool pad. Gently scrub the wheel with the steel wool to remove any remaining chrome plating. Be sure to apply pressure evenly and cover the entire wheel.



Once you have finished buffing and steel wooling the wheel, it's time to apply a chrome removal solution. This solution will help to dissolve any remaining chrome plating from the wheel. Apply the solution to the wheel and allow it to sit for 15-20 minutes. After the allotted time has passed, wipe away the solution with a soft cloth.



After you have removed all the chrome plating, it is important to wax the wheel. Waxing will help to protect the wheel's original finish and keep it looking new. Apply wax in a thin layer and buff it with a soft cloth.
