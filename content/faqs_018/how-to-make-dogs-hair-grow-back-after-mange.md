<p>Mange is a skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin and cause lesions, hair loss, and itching. While the condition is not usually serious and is treatable, it can leave the dog feeling uncomfortable and their coat looking patchy. Fortunately, most dogs can make a full recovery with the right treatment and care. In this article, we’ll look at how to make a dog’s hair grow back after mange and provide tips on how to care for your pup during the recovery process.</p>

<h2>What Is Mange?</h2>

<p>Mange is a skin condition caused by a mite infestation. These mites are incredibly small, typically measuring between 0.2-0.4 millimeters. The mites burrow into the skin and cause lesions, itching, and hair loss. The condition is highly contagious and can be passed from one animal to another, as well as to humans. There are two main types of mange – sarcoptic mange and demodectic mange – and both require treatment to prevent them from spreading. </p>

<h2>Sarcoptic Mange </h2>

<p>Sarcoptic mange, also known as scabies, is caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite. This type of mange is highly contagious and can be spread between animals and humans. Symptoms of sarcoptic mange include intense itching, redness, and a rash. </p>

<h2>Demodectic Mange </h2>

<p>Demodectic mange, also known as demodicosis, is caused by the Demodex canis mite. This type of mange is usually not contagious and occurs when a dog’s immune system is weakened or compromised. Symptoms of demodectic mange include hair loss, redness, and patchy skin. </p>

<h2>How to Make Dogs Hair Grow Back After Mange</h2>

<p>The first step in making a dog’s hair grow back after mange is to get the mites under control. This can be done by using a combination of topical medications, medicated baths, and other treatments prescribed by your vet. Once the mites are under control, the hair should begin to regrow. If the mites are not under control, the hair may not grow back. </p>

<h3>Medicated Baths</h3>

<p>Medicated baths are an important part of treating mange. These baths help to kill the mites, reduce inflammation, and reduce itching. Your vet may recommend a medicated shampoo or dip to use in the bath. Be sure to follow the directions on the product label carefully and avoid getting the product in your dog’s eyes or mouth. </p>

<h3>Topical Medications</h3>

<p>Topical medications are also used to treat mange. These medications are applied directly to the skin and are usually in the form of a cream, lotion, or ointment. These medications help to kill the mites, reduce itching, and reduce inflammation. Your vet will be able to recommend the best medication for your dog’s case of mange. </p>

<h3>Diet and Supplements</h3>

<p>Diet and supplements can also be beneficial in helping a dog’s hair grow back after mange. A diet high in essential fatty acids, such as omega-3 fatty acids, can help to reduce inflammation and promote healthy skin and hair. Supplements, such as vitamin B complex, may also help to reduce inflammation and promote healthy skin and hair. Your vet will be able to recommend the best diet and supplements for your dog. </p>

<h2>Tips for Caring for Your Dog During the Recovery Process</h2>
