<p>People have been fascinated by the idea of edible water for centuries, and the concept of edible water balls has been around since at least the 18th century. In recent years, edible water balls have been gaining in popularity, thanks to their convenience, eco-friendly packaging, and health benefits. But what exactly are edible water balls? And how do you make them? In this article, we'll answer these questions and show you how to make your own edible water balls.</p>

<h2>What Are Edible Water Balls?</h2>

<p>Edible water balls, sometimes referred to as Ooho globes, are small, spherical capsules of potable water. They are made of a biodegradable, plant-based membrane that is both flexible and strong. The membrane is made from a combination of calcium chloride and sodium alginate, a substance derived from seaweed. This combination forms a gel-like pouch that is filled with purified water.</p>

<p>The membrane is designed to be strong enough to hold the water inside, yet delicate enough that it can be easily consumed. The edible water balls are also designed to be as eco-friendly as possible, with the membrane being 100% biodegradable and compostable. As an added bonus, the membrane adds a mild, pleasant flavor to the water inside, making them a great alternative to plain old bottled water.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Edible Water Balls?</h2>

<p>Edible water balls offer a number of benefits over traditional bottled water. Firstly, they are much more eco-friendly than traditional plastic bottles, as they are fully biodegradable and compostable. Secondly, they are much more convenient to use and transport, as they take up much less space than regular bottles of water. Thirdly, they are much healthier, as they are made from natural, plant-based ingredients, rather than harsh chemicals.</p>

<p>Finally, edible water balls can be a great way to add a bit of flavor and variety to your water. As the membrane has a mild, pleasant flavor, you can add different flavors to the water inside, such as lemon or strawberry. This makes them a great way to add a bit of excitement to your water, without all the added sugar or calories of regular flavored waters.</p>

<h2>How to Make Edible Water Balls</h2>

<p>Making edible water balls is surprisingly easy and can be done with just a few simple ingredients. Here's what you'll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 cups of purified water</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of calcium chloride</li>
  <li>1/4 cup of sodium alginate</li>
  <li>A large bowl</li>
  <li>A spoon</li>
  <li>A container with a lid</li>
</ul>

<p>The first step is to combine the calcium chloride and sodium alginate in the large bowl. Mix them together until they are completely combined. Then add the purified water and stir until the mixture is completely dissolved. Once the mixture is ready, pour it into the container and place the lid on top. Place the container in the refrigerator and let it sit for at least two hours.</p>

<p>After the mixture has had time to cool and set, it is time to make the edible water balls. To do this, spoon out small amounts of the mixture and carefully drop them into a bowl of cold water. The cold water helps to form the balls and helps the membrane to form around the water.</p>

<p>Once the balls are formed, they are ready to be eaten. Simply pop them in your mouth and enjoy! You can also add different flavors to them, as mentioned above.</p>

<h2>Tips for Making Edible Water Balls</h2>

<p>Making edible water balls is relatively easy, but there are some tips and tricks you can use to make them even better. Here are a few tips to keep in mind when making your own edible water balls:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure to use purified water, as tap water may contain impurities that can affect the texture and taste of the water balls.</li>
  <li>When combining the calcium chloride and sodium alginate, make sure to stir until the mixture is completely dissolved. If there are any lumps, they can affect the texture of the water balls.</li>
  <li>When spooning out the mixture, make sure to use a spoon that is large enough so that the balls are the same size. This will ensure that they are even and consistent.</li>
  <li>Make sure to add the balls to cold water. This will help them to form and will also help them to keep their shape.</li>
  <li>If you want to add flavor to your water balls, make sure to add the flavorings after they are formed. Adding them before may cause the balls to break apart.</li>
</ul>
