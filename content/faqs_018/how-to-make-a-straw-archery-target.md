Making a straw archery target is a great way to get started because it is inexpensive and easy to do. In this article, we will show you how to make a straw archery target that will last for many years.</p>

<h2>What You Need to Make a Straw Archery Target</h2>

<p>To make a straw archery target, you will need the following materials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A large piece of cardboard or a cardboard box</li>
  <li>Straw (at least 2-3 bales)</li>
  <li>A utility knife or scissors</li>
  <li>A box cutter</li>
  <li>A drill with a large bit</li>
  <li>Heavy-duty staples or rope</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions for Making a Straw Archery Target</h2>

<p>Now that you have the materials you need, you are ready to make your straw archery target. Follow these steps to get started:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Cut the Cardboard</h3>

<p>Using the utility knife or scissors, cut the cardboard into two pieces. The first piece should be about 12-15 inches wide and 36-48 inches long. The second piece should be about 12-15 inches wide and 24-26 inches long.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Cut the Straw</h3>

<p>Using the box cutter, cut the straw into small pieces that are about three to four inches long. You can use a ruler or measuring tape to make sure the pieces are all the same size.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Assemble the Target</h3>

<p>Lay the longer piece of cardboard on the ground and cover it with the straw pieces. Make sure they are evenly spread out and that they cover the entire surface. Once you have them all in place, use the heavy-duty staples or rope to hold them in place.</p>

<p>Then, lay the shorter piece of cardboard on top of the straw and staple or tie it in place. This will be the back of the target.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Make the Bullseye</h3>

<p>Using the drill, make a large hole in the center of the target. This will be the bullseye. Make sure the hole is large enough so that any arrows that hit it will go through and not get stuck.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Hang the Target</h3>

<p>Now your target is ready to hang. Find a sturdy wall or post to hang the target from. Make sure it is at least six feet off the ground so that you can practice shooting from a distance. You can also use a hook or a bracket to hang the target from.</p>
