<h2>What Causes Menstrual Odor?</h2>

Menstrual odor is caused by the combination of menstrual fluid and bacteria that live in the vagina. Menstrual fluid contains proteins, sugars, and other substances that create a perfect environment for bacteria to thrive. The bacteria in the vagina break down these proteins and sugars, which produces an unpleasant odor. During menstruation, the amount of fluid and bacteria increases, resulting in a stronger, more noticeable odor.

<h3>Wear Breathable Underwear</h3>

It is important to wear breathable underwear during your period, as this will help to reduce the amount of moisture in the genital area and will reduce the risk of bacteria growth.
