<p>Football helmets are designed to protect a player’s head and face from serious injury, and a visor is an additional layer of protection that can be added to the helmet. Visors are made of shatter-resistant polycarbonate and can be tinted to reduce glare. Visors are helpful for players who need to protect their eyes from the sun, rain, and debris, as well as for players who require vision correction. Below are the steps for how to put a visor on a football helmet.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Choose a Visor</h2>

<p>The first step in putting a visor on a football helmet is to choose the right visor for the helmet. Visors come in several sizes and colors, so players should look for one that fits their helmet properly. Visors should fit snugly in the helmet and have a snug fit around the edges. Players should also check that the helmet has the correct mounting hardware before purchasing a visor.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Prepare the Helmet</h2>

<p>Before installing the visor, the helmet must be prepared. The helmet should be cleaned and dried before the visor is installed. Using a mild detergent and a soft cloth, players should clean the outer surface of the helmet, paying special attention to the area where the visor will be mounted. Once the helmet is clean, players should make sure that any mounting hardware is securely attached to the helmet.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Attach the Visor</h2>

<p>The next step is to attach the visor to the helmet. Visors come with mounting hardware that must be attached to the helmet. The mounting hardware consists of two screws, a bolt, and a washer. The screws should be inserted into the holes on the sides of the helmet, and the bolt and washer should be inserted into the center of the helmet. Once the mounting hardware is secure, the visor can be placed on the helmet and tightened down.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Adjust the Visor</h2>

<p>Once the visor is securely attached to the helmet, players should adjust the angle of the visor. This will ensure that the visor covers the player’s eyes properly and does not obstruct their vision. Players should also check to make sure that the visor does not move or shake when they move their head.</p>
