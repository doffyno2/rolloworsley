<p>La Croix is one of the most popular sparkling water brands on the market, but it isn't for everyone. Some people find the taste of La Croix decidedly unappealing and would like to find ways to make it more palatable. Luckily, there are a few easy ways to make La Croix taste better.</p>

<h2>Add Flavoring</h2>

<p>One of the easiest ways to make La Croix taste better is to add a few drops of flavoring. Many stores sell natural fruit or berry extracts that can be added to water to give it a delicious, fruity taste. Alternatively, you can buy premade La Croix flavored drinks that come with a separate flavoring packet that can be added to give the water an extra kick. Another option is to make your own flavored La Croix by adding slices of fresh fruit or berries to the water.</p>

<h2>Mix It With Juice</h2>

<p>If you don't like the taste of La Croix on its own, you can mix it with a little bit of juice. Just pour a few ounces of La Croix into a glass and then add a few ounces of your favorite juice. This will give the drink a more flavorful taste and make it much more enjoyable to drink. If you're looking for a low-calorie alternative to soda, this is a great option.</p>

<h2>Add Herbs and Spices</h2>

<p>If you're feeling adventurous, you can try adding herbs and spices to your La Croix. A few slices of lemon, lime, or orange can give the drink a zesty kick. You can also try adding a few pinches of cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices for a unique flavor. Herbal teas can also be added to La Croix for a more complex flavor.</p>

<h2>Use It As a Mixer</h2>

<p>La Croix can also be used as a mixer for alcoholic drinks. Just add a few ounces of La Croix to a glass of vodka, gin, or whiskey and you'll have a delicious and refreshing drink. You can also mix La Croix with other juices or cordials to make fruity cocktails.</p>
