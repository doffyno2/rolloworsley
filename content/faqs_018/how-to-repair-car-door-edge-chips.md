<h2>Step 1: Preparing the Surface</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing car door edge chips is to prepare the surface. Begin by sanding the area around the chip with sandpaper. This will help to blend the area, making it easier to fill the chip. After sanding, wipe away any dust or debris with a damp cloth.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Filling the Chip</h2>

<h2>Step 3: Applying the Paint</h2>

<p>Once the filler is dry and sanded, it’s time to apply the paint. Begin by taping off the area with painter’s tape. This will help to keep the paint from getting on other parts of the car. Once the area is taped off, apply a thin coat of primer to the chip. Allow the primer to dry, then apply a thin coat of touch-up paint. Allow the paint to dry, then apply a thin coat of clear coat to protect the paint. Allow the clear coat to dry before removing the tape.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Finishing Up</h2>
