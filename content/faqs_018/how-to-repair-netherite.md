Netherite is a valuable and rare material found in the Nether, a dangerous and unforgiving dimension in Minecraft. It is used to craft powerful tools and armor, and is the most durable material in the game. Crafting with Netherite requires a knowledge of the game and the resources available in the Nether, making it a difficult material to obtain.

<h2>What Is Needed to Repair Netherite?</h2>
