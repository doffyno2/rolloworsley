<p>If you own a Toyota Prius, you may have seen the “Maintenance Required” light come on. This indicates that the oil needs to be changed, and it’s important to do this regularly to keep your vehicle in tip-top shape. Here’s a guide on how to remove the Oil Maintenance Required light from your Toyota Prius 2010.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check Your Oil Level</h2>

<p>The first step is to check the oil level in your vehicle. You can do this by taking off the oil cap, located on the top of the engine, and looking inside. Make sure that the oil level is at the correct level. If it’s too low, add more oil until it’s at the correct level. Be careful not to overfill the engine; too much oil can cause damage.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Change the Oil Filter</h2>

<p>The next step is to change the oil filter. This is located at the bottom of the engine, and you’ll need to use a wrench to unscrew it. Once you’ve unscrewed the filter, take it out and replace it with a new one. Make sure that the new filter is properly secured before you start the engine.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Drain and Replace the Oil</h2>

<p>Once the filter is changed, you can now drain and replace the oil. To do this, locate the oil drain plug underneath the engine, and use a wrench to unscrew it. Once the plug is unscrewed, the oil will start to drain out. Make sure you have a container to catch the oil, as it’s important to dispose of it properly. Once all the oil has been drained, replace the drain plug and put in new oil. When you’re done, make sure that the oil level is at the correct level.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Reset the Maintenance Required Light</h2>

<p>Once you’ve changed the oil and replaced the filter, you now need to reset the Maintenance Required light. To do this, turn on the ignition and make sure that the engine is off. Press and hold the odometer reset button for 5 seconds. When the light goes off, release the button and turn off the ignition. You’ve now successfully reset the Maintenance Required light.</p>
