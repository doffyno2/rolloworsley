<p>Football is a popular and beloved sport around the world. It's a great way to keep fit, have fun and make friends. But, when a football won't hold air, it can be a real pain. If a football won't hold air, it's usually the result of a puncture or a failure in the bladder. Fixing a football that won't hold air isn't difficult, but it does require some patience and basic knowledge of the football.</p>

<h2>Steps to Fix a Football That Won't Hold Air</h2>

<p>The first step in fixing a football that won't hold air is to locate the cause of the problem. The most common causes of a football that won't hold air are punctures and a failure in the bladder. If the football is punctured, you'll need to patch the puncture. If the bladder has failed, you'll need to replace it. The following steps will help you fix a football that won't hold air.</p>

<h3>1. Inspect the Football</h3>

<p>Before you can fix a football that won't hold air, you need to inspect it. Look for any signs of punctures or tears. Also, check the bladder for any signs of damage. If you find a puncture or tear, mark it with a permanent marker. If the bladder is damaged, you'll need to replace it.</p>

<h3>2. Patch the Puncture</h3>

<p>If you've found a puncture in the football, you'll need to patch it. To do this, you'll need a football patch kit. The kit should include a patch, glue and a marker. Start by cleaning the puncture with a damp cloth. Then, apply the patch over the puncture. Use the marker to outline the patch, then apply the glue. Allow the glue to dry before inflating the football.</p>

<h3>3. Replace the Bladder</h3>

<p>If the bladder has failed, you'll need to replace it. To do this, you'll need a new bladder and some football glue. Start by removing the old bladder. Use a sharp knife to cut the bladder away from the football. Then, use scissors to cut the bladder into small pieces. Finally, apply the glue to the football and place the new bladder inside. Allow the glue to dry before inflating the football.</p>

<h3>4. Inflate the Football</h3>

<p>Once you've patched the puncture or replaced the bladder, you can inflate the football. To do this, use an air pump and an air hose. Connect the air hose to the pump and then to the football. Turn on the pump and inflate the football to the desired pressure. Once the football is fully inflated, turn off the pump and disconnect the air hose.</p>
