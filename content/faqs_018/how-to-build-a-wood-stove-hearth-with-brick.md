How to Build a Wood Stove Hearth with Brick - Step-by-Step Guide



Building a wood stove hearth with brick is a great way to add a touch of warmth and class to any room. Whether you're looking to replace an old wood stove hearth or simply want to add an eye-catching fireplace to your home, a brick hearth can provide a stylish and durable solution. In this article, we'll provide a step-by-step guide on how to build a wood stove hearth with brick, from preparation to finishing touches.



Before you begin building your wood stove hearth with brick, you'll need to make sure you have all the necessary materials and tools. You'll need bricks, mortar, a masonry trowel, a brick hammer, a level, a tape measure, and a brick saw or brick chisel. In addition, you'll need some sand and a bucket.

<h2>Position Your Hearth</h2>

Once you have all of your materials and tools, it's time to position your hearth. Ideally, your hearth should sit on an even and level surface. If the surface is too uneven, you may need to use sand or concrete to create a level surface.

<h2>Measure Your Hearth</h2>

Once you've found the perfect spot for your hearth, it's time to start measuring and laying out the brick. Use a tape measure to measure the length and width of your hearth. Then, using a chalk line, mark out the shape of the hearth.



Now that you've prepared the area and marked out the shape of the hearth, it's time to start laying the bricks. Start by laying the first course of bricks around the perimeter of the hearth. Make sure the bricks are level and even, and use a level to check your work.

<h2>Apply Mortar</h2>

Once you've laid the first course of bricks, it's time to apply mortar. To mix the mortar, mix one part cement, one part lime, and two parts sand in a bucket. Mix the mortar until it forms a thick paste-like consistency.

<h2>Lay the Bricks</h2>

To lay the bricks, start by applying a thin layer of mortar to the back of each brick. Then, press the brick firmly into place and use a masonry trowel to smooth out the mortar. Make sure to leave a small gap between each brick to allow for expansion and contraction.

<h2>Cutting the Bricks</h2>

If necessary, you may need to cut the bricks to fit the hearth. To do this, use a brick saw or a brick chisel and a hammer. Make sure to wear safety goggles when cutting the bricks.



After you've laid all of the bricks, it's time to add the finishing touches. Use a damp cloth to wipe away any excess mortar from the bricks. Then, use a masonry trowel to smooth out the mortar joints. Finally, use a brush to brush away any debris from the surface of the hearth.
