<p>Gaps between the stove and countertop can be a real nuisance. Whether you’re cooking a meal or cleaning up after one, there’s nothing more annoying than trying to get food and crumbs out of the cracks. Luckily, there are several ways to fix this problem, from temporary solutions to long-term fixes. Read on to learn how to fix the gap between your stove and countertop.</p>

<h2>1. Use a Gap Filler or Hot Glue</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a quick and easy fix for the gap between your stove and countertop, consider using a gap filler or hot glue. Both of these will work to temporarily seal the gap, preventing food and crumbs from getting stuck in the crevices. However, it’s important to note that these solutions are only temporary – they won’t last forever and you’ll have to replace them every few months. </p>

<h2>2. Install a Seamless Countertop</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a more permanent solution, consider installing a seamless countertop. This type of countertop has no gaps between the stove and countertop, making it much easier to keep clean and free of food and crumbs. The downside is that it can be expensive – you may have to hire a professional to install it. However, it’s worth it if you want a long-term solution to your gap problem.</p>

<h2>3. Use Silicone Caulk</h2>

<p>Silicone caulk is another great way to fix the gap between your stove and countertop. It’s relatively inexpensive and easy to use. All you have to do is apply the caulk to the gap, let it dry, and then enjoy a seamless countertop. Just make sure to use a food-safe caulk, as some caulk may contain toxic chemicals. </p>

<h2>4. Use a Seamless Countertop Sticker</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for an even easier solution to your gap problem, consider using a seamless countertop sticker. These stickers are made of a thin vinyl material and are designed to cover up the gap between your stove and countertop. They’re easy to install, and they come in a variety of styles so you can choose one that suits your kitchen’s decor.</p>

This type of insert is made of a durable material, such as stainless steel, and is designed to fit into the gap between your stove and countertop.
