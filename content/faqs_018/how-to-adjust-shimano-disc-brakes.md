<p>Disc brakes on a bike offer improved performance and control over traditional rim brakes. Shimano disc brakes are some of the most popular on the market, and for good reason. They are reliable, easy to install, and relatively inexpensive. With the right tools and a few simple steps, you can adjust your Shimano disc brakes and make sure they are working properly.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>
<p>Before you begin adjusting your Shimano disc brakes, it is important to make sure that you have all of the necessary tools. The most important tool for this job is a flat-head screwdriver. You will also need a 5mm hex wrench and a 10mm wrench. Finally, you will need a pair of side cutters and a tube of Shimano disc brake compound.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Unscrew the Brake Pads</h2>
<p>The first step in adjusting your Shimano disc brakes is to unscrew the brake pads. To do this, use the flat-head screwdriver to loosen the two screws that hold the pads in place. Once the screws are loosened, you can carefully remove the pads from the brakes.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Position of the Pads</h2>
<p>Once the pads are removed, you will need to adjust the position of the pads so that they are aligned with the rotor. To do this, use the 5mm hex wrench to loosen the two screws on the back of the brake caliper. Once the screws are loosened, you can adjust the position of the pads so that they are lined up with the rotor.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Tighten the Brake Pads</h2>
<p>Once the pads are in position, you will need to tighten the screws on the back of the brake caliper. To do this, use the 10mm wrench to tighten the two screws. Make sure that the screws are tight and that the pads are securely in place.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Install the Shimano Disc Brake Compound</h2>
<p>The last step in adjusting your Shimano disc brakes is to install the Shimano disc brake compound. To do this, use the side cutters to cut off a small piece of the compound. Then, use your finger to spread the compound on the back of the pads. This will help to reduce friction and ensure that the pads move smoothly when you apply the brakes.</p>
