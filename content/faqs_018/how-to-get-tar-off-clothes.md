<p>Tar is a sticky, black substance that can be difficult to remove from clothes. It is made up of a variety of petroleum products and can be found on roads or pavements. Tar can be difficult to remove, but there are methods to get tar off clothes without causing further damage to the fabric.</p>

<h2>Removing Tar from Clothes</h2>

<p>The first step to removing tar is to determine what type of tar is on the fabric. Tar can be asphalt, coal tar, or pitch tar. Asphalt is the most common type of tar and is often used on roads and pathways. It is dark in color and has a sticky consistency. Coal tar is used for waterproofing and is black in color. Pitch tar is the least common type of tar and is used in roofing and paving. It is brown in color and is more difficult to remove than asphalt or coal tar.</p>

Finally, rinse the detergent off with a damp cloth. Repeat the process until all the tar has been removed.</p>
