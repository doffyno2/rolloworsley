<p>Camping is a common tactic used by killers in the popular horror game Dead by Daylight. It involves the killer waiting in a certain spot, usually near a generator or exit gate, and ambushing unsuspecting survivors as they pass by. This can be very frustrating for survivors, as it can make them feel as if they are unable to escape the killer. In this article, we'll discuss how to deal with camping killers in Dead by Daylight.</p>

<h2>Know Your Surroundings</h2>

<p>The first step to dealing with camping killers in Dead by Daylight is to familiarize yourself with your surroundings. Knowing where the exits and generators are located can help you plan your escape route and avoid getting ambushed by the killer. Additionally, if you know where the killer is likely to be camping, you can adjust your strategy accordingly and make a break for it when they least expect it.</p>

<h2>Use Distractions</h2>

<p>Distractions are a great way to throw off the killer's plan and give you a chance to make your escape. Noise makers, such as bear traps and firecrackers, can be used to draw the killer away from their camping spot, allowing survivors to make a break for it. Additionally, survivors can use pallets and windows to stun the killer and create an opening for them to make their escape.</p>

<h2>Work Together</h2>

<p>When dealing with camping killers, it's important to remember that you are not alone. Working together with other survivors can be an effective way to distract the killer and make your escape. By coordinating your actions, you can make it difficult for the killer to focus on one survivor, giving you an opportunity to make a break for it. Additionally, one survivor can act as a decoy while the other survivors make their escape.</p>

<h2>Be Patient</h2>

<p>It's important to remember that camping killers can be unpredictable, so it's important to have patience. Don't be afraid to wait for the right opportunity to make your escape. Sometimes, the best way to deal with a camping killer is to simply wait for them to move on. This can be a difficult strategy, as it requires patience and a willingness to put yourself at risk, but it can be an effective way to deal with these types of killers.</p>

<h2>Avoid Panic</h2>

<p>When dealing with camping killers, it's important to remain calm and focused. Panic can cause you to make mistakes and put yourself in danger. Instead, try to focus on your plan and stay alert. This will help you remain in control and make it easier to make your escape.</p>
