<p>The maintenance required light on a Toyota RAV4 is designed to remind drivers that regular maintenance is necessary for optimal vehicle performance. The purpose of the light is to indicate when it is time to change the oil, rotate the tires, or perform other routine services. However, when the light doesn't go off after the maintenance has been completed, it can be a source of frustration. To help you out, we will walk you through how to clear the maintenance required light on your Toyota RAV4.</p>

<h2>Check the Oil Level</h2>

<p>The first step in clearing the maintenance required light is to check the oil level. The oil level must be full in order for the light to turn off. To check the oil level, open the hood of your vehicle and locate the dipstick. Remove the dipstick and wipe it clean. Insert the dipstick back into the engine, then remove it again. Check the oil level against the "full" line on the dipstick. If the oil level is low, top it off with the proper type of oil. Once the oil is full, replace the dipstick and close the hood.</p>

<h2>Change the Oil and Filter</h2>

<p>If the oil level is full, then the next step is to change the oil and filter. Locate the oil filter and unscrew it from the engine. Remove the old filter and replace it with a new one. Tighten the filter securely. Then, remove the drain plug from the engine to drain the oil. Once the oil has drained, put the plug back in and add the recommended amount of new oil. Once the oil has been changed, start the engine and allow it to run for a few minutes. This will help to circulate the new oil and lubricate the engine.</p>

<h2>Rotate the Tires</h2>

<p>The next step in clearing the maintenance required light is to rotate the tires. This will help to ensure that all four tires wear evenly and last longer. To rotate the tires, first raise the vehicle with a car jack and support it with jack stands. Then, remove the wheel lug nuts and take off the tires. Move the front tires to the back and the back tires to the front. Make sure all of the tires are placed on the same side of the vehicle. Once the tires have been rotated, put the wheel lug nuts back on and lower the vehicle from the jack stands. When the vehicle is back on the ground, take it for a short drive to ensure that the tires are properly balanced.</p>

<h2>Check the Air Filter</h2>

<p>The air filter should also be checked when resetting the maintenance required light. To do this, locate the air filter box and open it. Remove the old filter and replace it with a new one. Make sure the new filter is the correct size and type for your vehicle. Once the filter has been replaced, close the box and start the engine. Let the engine run for a few minutes to ensure that the new filter is working properly.</p>

<h2>Check the Spark Plugs</h2>

<p>The spark plugs should also be checked when resetting the maintenance required light. To do this, locate the spark plugs and remove them from the engine. Inspect the plugs for signs of wear or damage. If the plugs are worn or damaged, replace them with new ones. Once the plugs have been replaced, start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to ensure that the new plugs are working properly.</p>

<h2>Reset the Light</h2>

<p>Once all of the maintenance tasks have been completed and checked, it is time to reset the maintenance required light. To do this, locate the OBD-II port under the dashboard and plug in an OBD-II scanner. Turn on the scanner and select the option to reset the maintenance required light. Follow the instructions on the scanner to reset the light. When the light has been reset, unplug the scanner and start the engine. The maintenance required light should now be off.</p>
