<p>Stranded Deep is a survival game that has become increasingly popular over the years. It puts the player in the shoes of a shipwrecked survivor, and challenges them to survive in the open ocean. While the game has received positive reviews, one common complaint is that the default backpack size is too small. This can make it difficult to store the items needed to survive in the open ocean.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are ways to increase the backpack size in Stranded Deep, which can give players a much-needed advantage when trying to survive in the open ocean. In this article, weâ€™ll discuss how to increase backpack size in Stranded Deep, as well as the benefits of doing so.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Default Backpack Size</h2>

<p>The default backpack size in Stranded Deep is 32 slots. This means that the player can store a maximum of 32 items in their backpack. This might sound like a lot, but when you consider the items necessary for survival, such as tools, food, and building materials, it quickly becomes apparent that 32 is not enough.</p>

<p>This is especially true when the player is trying to build structures, as they will need a lot of materials that cannot all fit in the default backpack size. This can lead to a lot of frustration, as the player will have to continually go back and forth between the shore and their base in order to get the materials they need.</p>

<h2>Increasing the Backpack Size</h2>

<p>Fortunately, there are ways to increase the backpack size in Stranded Deep. One way is to craft a larger backpack, which can increase the backpack size from 32 to 64 slots. This can be done by crafting four pieces of cloth, which can then be used to craft a larger backpack.</p>

<p>Another way to increase the backpack size is to craft a storage box. This is more efficient than a larger backpack, as it can hold up to 128 items. To craft a storage box, the player will need four pieces of wood, four pieces of cloth, and four pieces of rope. Once crafted, the storage box can be placed anywhere in the game world and used to store items.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Increasing the Backpack Size</h2>

<p>One of the biggest benefits of increasing the backpack size in Stranded Deep is that it allows the player to store more items. This gives them more freedom to explore the open ocean, as they will not have to worry about running out of space for the items they need. It also makes it easier to build structures, as the player will have more items on hand.</p>

<p>Another benefit is that it reduces the amount of time the player has to spend going back and forth between the shore and their base. This can save a lot of time, which can be better spent exploring the open ocean or gathering resources.</p>
