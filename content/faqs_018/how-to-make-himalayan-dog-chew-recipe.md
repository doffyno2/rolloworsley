<h2>The Benefits of Himalayan Dog Chews</h2>

<h2>How to Make Himalayan Dog Chews</h2>

<p>Making Himalayan dog chews at home is actually quite simple. All you need is some yak or cow milk, a few basic ingredients, and some time. Here’s what you’ll need to get started: </p>

<ul>
  <li>1 liter of yak or cow milk</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons of lemon juice</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of sea salt</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon of black pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>Begin by heating the milk in a large pot over medium-high heat. Once the milk begins to bubble, reduce the heat to low and add the lemon juice. Stir the mixture until the lemon juice is fully incorporated. Once the milk begins to thicken, add the baking soda, sea salt, and black pepper. Stir the mixture until all ingredients are fully incorporated. </p>

<p>Remove the pot from the heat and pour the mixture onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Spread the mixture evenly on the baking sheet and allow it to cool completely. Once the mixture is completely cool, use a sharp knife to cut the mixture into small cubes. Place the cubes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes, or until the cubes are golden brown. Allow the cubes to cool completely and then store them in an airtight container. </p>
