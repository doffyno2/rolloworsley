<p>Aluminum wheels are popular for their attractive appearance and durability. They are also relatively easy to maintain and can last for many years. However, aluminum wheels are prone to getting pitted over time due to exposure to the elements. If your aluminum wheels have become pitted, it can be difficult to restore them to their original condition. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to remove the pits and restore their shine.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Clean and Prep the Wheels</h2>

<p>Before you can begin polishing, it is important to properly clean and prep the wheels. Begin by washing the wheels with soap and water. Once the wheels are clean, use a cloth or brush to remove any dirt, debris, and grime. After the wheels are clean, use a plastic-safe degreaser to remove any oil or grease from the surface. Be sure to follow the instructions on the degreaser to ensure that it is used safely and effectively.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Sand the Pitted Areas</h2>

<p>Once the wheels are prepped and clean, you can begin to sand down the pitted areas. To do this, you will need a sandpaper, preferably a finer grit like 600 or 800. Begin by sanding the pitted areas in a gentle circular motion. Be sure to sand evenly and carefully to avoid damaging the wheels. Once you have sanded the pitted areas, you can move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Use a Polishing Compound</h2>

<p>Once the pitted areas have been sanded, you will need to use a polishing compound to restore the shine and luster of the wheels. Begin by applying a small amount of the polishing compound to a cloth or sponge. Rub the compound into the wheels in a gentle circular motion. Be sure to cover the entire wheel, paying special attention to the pitted areas. After the wheels have been polished, use a clean cloth to wipe away any excess compound.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Apply a Wheel Protector</h2>

<p>Once the wheels have been polished, you can apply a wheel protector. This will help to protect the wheels from further damage and keep them looking their best. To apply the wheel protector, simply spray it onto the wheels and allow it to dry. Be sure to follow the instructions on the wheel protector to ensure that it is applied correctly.</p>
