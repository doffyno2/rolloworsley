Dogs are sensitive creatures that can hear a range of sounds that humans can’t. Unfortunately, this means that some of the noises we make can be irritating for our canine friends. One of the sounds that dogs hate the most is high-frequency noise – but how do you make this sound, and why do dogs hate it so much?
