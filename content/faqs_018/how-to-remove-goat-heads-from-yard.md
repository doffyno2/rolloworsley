<p>Goat heads, also known as puncturevine, are a type of weed that can be detrimental to your yard and garden. They have sharp spines that can puncture your skin and the tires on your car. In this article, we'll discuss why goat heads are so difficult to remove, and provide several tips to help you remove them from your yard. </p>

<h2>What are Goat Heads?</h2>

<p>Goat heads are a type of weed that grows in many parts of the United States. The plant has small, spiny seeds which can easily puncture your skin and the tires on your car. The plant itself is easy to identify, as it has a distinctive shape and color. The leaves are deeply lobed and are a yellowish-green color. In addition, the stems of the plant are covered in tiny thorns. </p>

<h2>Why are Goat Heads so Hard to Remove?</h2>

<p>Goat heads are notoriously difficult to remove because of their small, spiny seeds. The seeds easily get lodged into the soil and can remain in the ground for years. In addition, the roots of the plant are deep and can reach several feet below the surface. This makes the plant very hard to dig up and remove. </p>

<h2>How to Remove Goat Heads from Your Yard</h2>

<h3>Pull Them Out By Hand</h3>

<p>The easiest way to remove goat heads from your yard is to simply pull them out by hand. Use a pair of gardening gloves to protect your hands from the spines. If the roots of the plant are shallow, you may be able to pull the entire plant out of the ground. Otherwise, you may need to use a shovel or garden hoe to dig up the roots. </p>

<h3>Mulch the Area</h3>

<p>Mulching the area around the plant can be an effective way to prevent the plant from growing back. By placing a thick layer of mulch over the affected area, you can prevent the seeds from germinating and taking root. </p>

<h3>Use a Weed Killer</h3>

<p>If the goat heads have already taken root and are difficult to remove, you may need to use a weed killer. Choose an herbicide that is specifically designed to kill goat heads. Make sure to follow the directions carefully and wear protective clothing when applying the herbicide. </p>

<h3>Cover the Area with Plastic</h3>

<p>If you don't want to use an herbicide, you can cover the area with plastic. This will prevent the seeds from getting air, water, and sunlight, and will eventually kill the plant. Make sure to use a thick layer of plastic and secure it with rocks or stakes. </p>
