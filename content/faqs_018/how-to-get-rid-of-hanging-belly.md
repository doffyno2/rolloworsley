<p>Having a hanging belly can be an embarrassing sight, especially if you’ve been hitting the gym for months with no visible results. It is often caused by factors such as age, weight gain, pregnancy, and genetics. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to get rid of a hanging belly and get the flat stomach of your dreams.</p>

<h2>What Causes Hanging Belly?</h2>

<p>A hanging belly is often caused by weight gain, which weakens and stretches the abdominal muscles. This can be a result of an unhealthy lifestyle, such as eating too much and not exercising enough. Age can also play a role, as the skin loses its elasticity and can’t keep up with the shrinking muscles. Additionally, pregnancy can cause the stomach muscles to weaken and the skin to stretch, leading to a hanging belly. Genetics can also be a factor, as some people are naturally predisposed to having a hanging belly.</p>
