<p>Rotator cuff repair surgery is a common procedure for repairing the four muscles and tendons that make up the rotator cuff. It is usually performed to treat shoulder pain and weakness caused by rotator cuff tears. Once you’ve had the surgery, it’s natural to wonder how soon you can return to your regular activities, including running. Here we’ll discuss what you can expect after your rotator cuff repair surgery and how long you’ll need to wait before running again.</p>

<h2>What is the Recovery Process Like After Rotator Cuff Repair Surgery?</h2>

Your physical therapist will develop a customized post-operative rehabilitation program for you, which will include exercises to help you regain range of motion and strength in your shoulder. Activities such as lifting, reaching, and pushing may be limited for up to three months after surgery. Your doctor will also likely recommend avoiding contact sports or activities that require a lot of shoulder use, such as tennis or swimming, for up to six months after surgery.</p>
