Faux leather furniture looks great in many homes, but it can take a beating over time. If your faux leather furniture has scratches, don’t worry. You can repair them easily and get your furniture looking like new again. In this article, we’ll discuss how to repair scratches to faux leather furniture and make it look like new.

<h2>What Is Faux Leather?</h2>

Faux leather, also known as pleather or vinyl leather, is a synthetic material made to look and feel like leather without the use of animal hides. Faux leather is often used to create furniture, clothing and accessories, and is popular due to its low cost and durability.

<h2>What Causes Scratches to Faux Leather Furniture?</h2>

Scratches on faux leather furniture can be caused by a variety of things, including pets, children, and everyday wear and tear. Faux leather is fairly durable, but it can still get scratched over time.

<h2>How Can I Repair Scratches to Faux Leather Furniture?</h2>

The first step in repairing scratches to faux leather furniture is to clean the area thoroughly. Use a damp cloth and mild soap to remove any dirt, dust, or debris from the scratch.

Once the area has been cleaned, use a soft, damp cloth to apply a small amount of leather conditioner to the scratch. Gently rub the leather conditioner into the scratch, using circular motions. This will help to soften and condition the faux leather and make it more pliable.

Once the leather conditioner has been applied, use a leather patch kit to repair the scratch. The patch kit should contain a patch of faux leather that is the same color and texture as your furniture. Cut the patch to fit the size of the scratch, then use a leather adhesive to attach the patch to the furniture.

Once the patch is in place, use a soft cloth to buff the area. This will help to blend the patch in with the rest of the faux leather and give it a more natural look.

<h2>How Can I Prevent Scratches to Faux Leather Furniture?</h2>

The best way to prevent scratches to faux leather furniture is to be mindful of how you use it. Be careful when placing items on the furniture, as sharp objects can cause scratches. Also, make sure to keep pets away from the furniture, as their claws can also cause scratches.

If you have children, teach them to be gentle with the furniture and not to use sharp objects on it. You should also consider using furniture covers when the furniture is not in use, as this will help to protect it from dust and other particles that can cause scratches.
