<p>Biking is a great way to stay active and have fun, but it’s also important to stay safe. One of the most important pieces of safety equipment for any cyclist is a properly fitting helmet. Giro bike helmets are some of the most popular on the market, but even the best helmets need to be adjusted for the perfect fit.

<h3>Step 3: Make Sure the Helmet Is Level</h3>

<p>Finally, make sure that the helmet is level on your head. The front of the helmet should sit just above your eyebrows, and the back should be level with the back of your head. Once you have the helmet adjusted to the proper size, you’re ready to hit the road!</p>
