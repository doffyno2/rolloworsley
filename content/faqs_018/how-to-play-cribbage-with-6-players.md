Cribbage is a popular card game that can be played with two, three, or four players. However, with the correct setup and some modifications, it can also be played with five or six players. This guide will show you how to play cribbage with six players.

<h2>What You Need to Play Cribbage with 6 Players</h2>

To play cribbage with six players, you will need the following:

<ul>
<li>Six players*</li>
<li>Two standard decks of cards (104 cards total)</li>
<li>A cribbage board or a score pad</li>
<li>Cribbage pegs (optional)</li>
</ul>

*Note: Cribbage can be played with any number of players, but it is most commonly played with two, three, or four players.

<h2>Setting Up the Game</h2>

When playing cribbage with six players, it is important to set up the game correctly. To do this, you will need to make some modifications to the standard game.

<h3>Deck Modifications</h3>

Since there are six players, you will need two standard decks of cards. However, the decks must be modified before play begins. To do this, remove the eight jokers from the two decks, as well as two of the four twos. This will leave you with two decks of ninety-eight cards.

<h3>Player Seating</h3>

The six players should be seated in a circle, with three players on each side. The dealer should be in the middle, with the players on either side.

<h3>Cribbage Board or Score Pad</h3>

You will need a cribbage board or a score pad to keep track of the scores. The dealer should be in charge of keeping track of the scores.

<h2>How to Play Cribbage with 6 Players</h2>

Once you have set up the game, you can begin to play. Cribbage is played in rounds and each round consists of several steps.

<h3>Dealing the Cards</h3>

The first step is to deal the cards. The dealer should start by dealing one card to each player, starting with the player to their left. The dealer should continue to deal cards until each player has six cards.

<h3>Selecting Two Cards for the Crib</h3>

Once each player has six cards, the next step is for each player to select two cards from their hand to place in the crib. The crib is a special pile of cards that is shared by all players. The dealer should select their two cards last.

<h3>The Play</h3>

Once the crib has been set up, the play begins. The player to the left of the dealer should start by playing one card from their hand. The other players should then play one card each in turn, until all players have played six cards. The goal is to make the highest-scoring combination of cards.

<h3>Scoring</h3>

Once all players have played their cards, the dealer should score the hands. The dealer should score each hand separately, starting with their own. The player with the highest score wins that round. The dealer should then move on to the next player, and so on until all players have been scored.

<h3>Ending the Round</h3>

Once all players have been scored, the round is over. The dealer should then collect all of the cards and start a new round.
