Nylon gears are a common part in most machinery, from cars to washing machines. They are durable and relatively inexpensive, making them a popular choice for manufacturers. Unfortunately, they are also prone to cracking. If you’ve noticed cracked or broken nylon gears in your machinery, you’ll need to know how to repair them. 

<h2>What Causes Nylon Gears to Crack?</h2>

Nylon gears are usually made out of a plastic-like material, which makes them more flexible and less prone to breaking. However, they can still crack if they are subjected to too much stress or strain. This can happen due to a variety of factors, such as:

<h3>Heat:</h3>
Nylon gears can get too hot and become brittle, which can cause them to crack. This can happen if the machinery they are in is running too hot, or if they are exposed to direct sunlight for too long.

<h3>Excessive Pressure:</h3>
If the gears are overloaded or put under too much pressure, they can crack. This is especially true if the gears are old or worn out.

<h3>Age:</h3>
Over time, nylon gears can become brittle and crack. This is especially true if the gears are exposed to a lot of wear and tear, or if they are not properly lubricated.

<h2>How to Repair Cracked Nylon Gears</h2>

If you’ve noticed cracked or broken nylon gears in your machinery, there are a few things you can do to repair them:

<h3>Replace the Gears:</h3>
The easiest way to repair cracked nylon gears is to simply replace them with new ones. This is usually the most cost effective solution, and will ensure that your machinery is running smoothly. 

<h3>Repair the Gears:</h3>
If you don’t want to replace the gears, you can try to repair them. This is usually done by filling the cracks with a special epoxy or glue. Make sure to use a product that is specifically designed for nylon gears. 

<h3>Lubricate the Gears:</h3>
If the gears are not properly lubricated, the friction between them can cause them to crack. Make sure to lubricate them regularly with a lubricant that is specifically designed for nylon gears. 

<h2>Tips for Preventing Cracked Nylon Gears</h2>

There are a few things you can do to prevent your nylon gears from cracking in the future:

<h3>Inspect the Gears Regularly:</h3>
Regularly inspect your gears for signs of wear and tear, such as cracks or chips. If you notice any damage, replace the gears immediately.

<h3>Use the Right Lubricant:</h3>
Make sure to use the right lubricant for your nylon gears. This will help reduce friction and keep your gears running smoothly.

<h3>Keep the Gears Cool:</h3>
Excessive heat can cause your nylon gears to become brittle and crack. Make sure to keep your machinery cool by using fans or other cooling devices.
