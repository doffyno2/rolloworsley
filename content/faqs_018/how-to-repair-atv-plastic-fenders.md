<p>ATV plastic fenders are an important part of the overall design of your ATV. They protect the rider from flying debris, mud, and water while you are out enjoying the trails. Unfortunately, ATV plastic fenders are also prone to cracking, splitting, and breaking when they are exposed to tough riding conditions. In order to keep your ATV in tip-top shape, it is important to repair any damage to the plastic fenders as soon as possible. Here is a guide on how to repair ATV plastic fenders so that you can keep riding without worry.</p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies Needed</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing your ATV plastic fenders is to gather the necessary tools and supplies. You will need a few basic tools and supplies, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Heat gun</li>
  <li>Plastic fender repair kit</li>
  <li>Masking tape</li>
  <li>Sandpaper</li>
  <li>Filler</li>
  <li>Primer</li>
  <li>Paint</li>
  <li>Clean cloths</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing the Fender for Repair</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered the necessary tools and supplies, you can begin to prepare the fender for repair. Start by cleaning the area around the damaged fender with a clean cloth. This will help to remove any dirt or debris that may have accumulated in the area. Once you have cleaned the area, use masking tape to cover any parts of the fender that you do not want to damage with the heat gun. This will help to protect the surrounding areas from the heat.</p>

<h2>Using the Heat Gun</h2>

<p>Once the area is prepped, you can begin to use the heat gun to soften the plastic. Hold the heat gun a few inches away from the fender and move it in a circular motion. Be sure to keep the heat gun moving in order to prevent any burning or damage to the plastic. Once the plastic is softened, you can begin to use the plastic fender repair kit.</p>

<h2>Using the Fender Repair Kit</h2>

<p>The fender repair kit will typically come with a few items, such as a plastic patch, filler, and primer. Begin by using sandpaper to sand down the area around the damaged fender. Once the area is sanded down, you can begin to apply the plastic patch. Place the patch over the damaged area and use a heat gun to shrink the patch onto the fender. Once the patch is in place, use filler to fill in any gaps or cracks. Allow the filler to dry and then sand it down until it is smooth. Finally, apply a coat of primer and allow it to dry before applying your desired paint color.</p>

<h2>Final Steps</h2>

<p>Once you have completed the repair process, it is important to inspect the fender for any remaining damage. If you find any damage, repeat the repair process until the fender is completely repaired. Once the fender is fully repaired, you can reinstall it on your ATV and you will be ready to hit the trails again.</p>
