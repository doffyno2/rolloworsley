<p>The Toyota Highlander has become one of the most popular mid-size SUVs on the market. It has a reliable and capable engine, a roomy interior, and is loaded with features. One of the important maintenance tasks that you must perform on a regular basis is to reset the oil maintenance light. This will ensure that your vehicle is running efficiently and will help extend its life.</p>

<h2>How Does the Oil Maintenance Light Work?</h2>

<p>The oil maintenance light is designed to alert you when it is time to change your vehicleâ€™s oil and filter. It will usually come on when the oil level is low or when the oil has reached the end of its service life. The oil maintenance light will usually come on in two stages. The first stage is a yellow light that will come on to notify you that it will soon be time to change your oil. The second stage is a red light that will come on to notify you that it is time to change your oil right away.</p>

<h2>What Do You Need to Reset the Oil Maintenance Light?</h2>

<p>In order to reset the oil maintenance light, you will need a few basic tools. First, you will need a flat-head screwdriver. This will be used to remove the panel that houses the oil filter. You will also need a new oil filter, a wrench, and a socket set. You may also need some rags or a paper towel to clean up any mess. Finally, you will need some fresh engine oil.</p>

<h2>Steps to Reset the Oil Maintenance Light</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Locate the Oil Filter</h3>

<p>The first step is to locate the oil filter. On a Toyota Highlander, the oil filter is located near the front of the engine compartment. It is a cylindrical metal canister that is held in place by two bolts. Use the flat-head screwdriver to remove the panel that covers the oil filter.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Remove the Old Oil Filter</h3>

<p>Once you have exposed the oil filter, use the wrench to remove the two bolts that are holding it in place. Once the bolts have been removed, you can pull the oil filter out of its housing. Make sure to place the old oil filter in a plastic bag or container to dispose of it properly.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Install the New Oil Filter</h3>

<p>Once the old oil filter has been removed, you can install the new one. Use the socket set to secure the new filter in place. Be sure to tighten the bolts securely to ensure that the filter is properly sealed.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add Oil and Reset the Light</h3>

<p>Once the new oil filter is in place, you can add the fresh oil. Use a funnel to pour the oil into the engine compartment. Once the oil has been added, you can use the flat-head screwdriver to reset the oil maintenance light. The light should turn off after a few seconds.</p>
