<p>If you’ve ever encountered a stripped screw on an iPhone, you know how frustrating it can be. Stripped screws are a common problem when it comes to repairing or disassembling iPhones. Luckily, there are a few ways to get a stripped screw out of an iPhone without having to buy special tools or call a professional. With some patience and the right technique, you can get a stripped screw out of an iPhone in no time.</p>

<h2>What Causes Stripped Screws?</h2>

<p>Stripped screws are caused by over-tightening the screws or using the wrong size screwdriver. iPhone screws are very small, and it is easy to strip them if you are not careful. Using a screwdriver that is too big or too small can also cause this issue, as it can damage the head of the screw.</p>

<h2>Tools You’ll Need</h2>

<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is gather the right tools. You’ll need a pair of tweezers, a rubber band, a pair of needle-nose pliers, and a Phillips-head screwdriver. It’s important to make sure the screwdriver is the correct size for the screws in your iPhone.</p>

<h2>Method 1: Using a Rubber Band</h2>

<p>The first method for getting a stripped screw out of an iPhone is to use a rubber band. To do this, take a rubber band and wrap it around the head of the stripped screw. Then, use a pair of tweezers to hold the rubber band in place. Next, use the screwdriver to turn the screw in a counter-clockwise direction. The rubber band will help the screwdriver grip the screw and should allow you to turn it.</p>

<h2>Method 2: Using Needle-Nose Pliers</h2>

<p>If the rubber band method doesn’t work, you can try using needle-nose pliers. To do this, take the needle-nose pliers and grip the head of the stripped screw. Then, turn the pliers in a counter-clockwise direction to loosen the screw. Be careful not to damage the head of the screw while doing this.</p>

<h2>Method 3: Using a Screw Extractor</h2>

<p>If you can’t get the screw out using the methods above, you may need to use a screw extractor. A screw extractor is a special tool designed to remove stripped screws. To use a screw extractor, first drill a small hole in the head of the screw. Then, use the screw extractor to grip the screw and turn it in a counter-clockwise direction. This should allow you to remove the screw.</p>
