<h2>What You Need for Preserving Roses in Resin</h2>

Before you begin preserving your roses in resin, you will need to gather some supplies. You will need the following:

<ul>
  <li>Resin – Choose a resin that is designed for casting and preserving items such as roses.</li>
  <li>Casting Molds – These come in a variety of shapes and sizes, so choose one that is suitable for the size of the rose you are preserving.</li>
  <li>Mixing Cups – Make sure you have at least two cups of different sizes. One cup should be larger than the other.</li>
  <li>Stirring Sticks – You can use wooden or plastic stirring sticks for this project.</li>
  <li>Protective Gear – You should wear gloves, a face mask, and safety glasses when working with resin.</li>
  <li>Paint Brushes – You will need a few paint brushes in different sizes for this project.</li>
  <li>Glue – You will need a strong, waterproof glue for this project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing the Roses for Preserving in Resin</h2>

Once you have gathered all of your supplies, you can begin to prepare the roses for preserving. You will need to cut the stems of the roses to the length you would like. Make sure that the roses are free of any dirt or debris. Once the roses have been cut and cleaned, you can begin to prepare the resin.

<h2>Mixing the Resin</h2>

Mixing the resin is the most important step in the process. Make sure you follow the instructions on the package carefully. It is important to mix the resin according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Once the resin has been mixed, you can begin to pour it into the mold.

<h2>Pouring the Resin</h2>

Pour the resin into the mold in an even layer. Once the mold is full, you can begin to place the roses into the mold. Make sure that the roses are placed in an even layer and that they are completely covered with the resin. Allow the resin to cure for at least 24 hours before removing the roses from the mold.

<h2>Finishing the Project</h2>

Once the roses have been removed from the mold, you can begin to finish the project. Use a paint brush to coat the roses in the resin. This will help to protect them and give them a glossy finish. Once the resin has dried, you can use a waterproof glue to attach the roses to any surface you would like.
