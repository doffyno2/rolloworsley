<p>Burnt water can be a real nuisance, especially when it comes to cleaning up stovetops. It can be difficult to remove and can leave behind a nasty, sticky residue. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps you can take to get the burnt water off of your stove in no time. With the right materials and a little elbow grease, you'll have your stove looking as good as new in no time.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you will need a few materials to get the job done right. Gather the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Dish soap</b></li>
  <li><b>Baking soda</b></li>
  <li><b>White vinegar</b></li>
  <li><b>Sponge</b></li>
  <li><b>Paper towels</b></li>
  <li><b>Stainless steel cleaner</b></li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Soak Up Excess Moisture</h2>

<p>The first step is to soak up any excess moisture that is left behind. Using a paper towel, blot the affected area until it is as dry as possible. If the paper towel becomes saturated with moisture, discard it and grab a new one.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Make a Paste</h2>

<p>Once you have soaked up as much of the moisture as possible, it is time to make a paste. In a small bowl, mix together equal parts baking soda and white vinegar. The mixture should be thick and pasty. If it is too thin, add more baking soda; if it is too thick, add a bit more vinegar.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply the Paste</h2>

<p>Once you have the paste ready, apply it to the affected area. Use a sponge or cloth to spread it evenly over the area. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the paste time to work its magic.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Scrub the Area</h2>

<p>After a few minutes, take the sponge or cloth and begin scrubbing the area. You may need to use some elbow grease to get the burnt water off. If the area is still too stubborn, you can apply more baking soda and vinegar paste and then scrub the area again.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Rinse the Area</h2>

<p>Once you have scrubbed the area, rinse it off with warm water. Be sure to remove all traces of the baking soda and vinegar mixture. You may need to use a bit of dish soap to help remove any stubborn residue.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Dry the Area</h2>

<p>Once you have rinsed the area, dry it off with a clean, dry cloth. Make sure the area is completely dry before moving on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 7: Polish the Area</h2>

<p>Finally, use a stainless steel cleaner to polish the area. This will help to remove any remaining residue and make the area shine. Use a soft cloth to apply the cleaner, and then buff the area until it is shiny and clean.</p>
