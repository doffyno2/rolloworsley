<p>Fox tails are a beautiful and interesting addition to many accessories and pieces of clothing. Whether you have a fox tail as part of a costume or simply as a decoration, it’s important to maintain it properly over time. Here are some tips on how to preserve a fox tail so it will last for many years.</p>

<h2>How To Clean a Fox Tail</h2>

<p>The first step in preserving a fox tail is to properly clean it. Start by shaking out any dirt or dust, and then use a soft brush to gently brush the fur. Be sure to pay special attention to the areas where the fur is more matted and tangled. You can also use a lint roller to help remove any stubborn debris.</p>

<p>Once you’ve removed the dirt and dust, you’ll want to spot clean the fox tail with a mild detergent. Use a cloth or sponge to gently massage the detergent into the fur, and then rinse it with clean water. Make sure to rinse the fur thoroughly to remove all traces of detergent, and then use a towel to blot the fur dry. Make sure to dry the fur completely before moving on to the next step.</p>

<h2>How To Store a Fox Tail</h2>

<p>Once the fox tail is clean and dry, it’s time to store it. You can store your fox tail in a plastic bag, or you can hang it on a wall to keep it out of the way. Either way, make sure the fur is completely dry before storing it. This will help to prevent mold and mildew from forming in the fur.</p>

<p>If you choose to store your fox tail in a plastic bag, make sure to leave the bag open to allow for air circulation. You can also use a cotton pillowcase to store your fox tail, as this allows for more air circulation and prevents the fur from becoming too damp. Whichever method you choose, make sure the fox tail is completely dry before storing it.</p>

<h2>How To Maintain a Fox Tail</h2>

<p>Once the fox tail is stored properly, it’s important to take steps to maintain it. You should brush the fur regularly to prevent it from becoming matted, and you should also vacuum the fur to remove any dirt or dust. If your fox tail starts to look dull or lifeless, you can use a fabric refresher to give it a boost.</p>

<p>If the fur of your fox tail becomes matted or tangled, you can use a wide-tooth comb to gently detangle the fur. Be sure to start from the tips of the fur and work your way up to the base. You can also use a fabric steamer to help loosen stubborn tangles and restore the fur’s natural luster.</p>
