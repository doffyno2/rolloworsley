When you’ve been enjoying your favorite sports drinks in a durable, reusable water bottle, it can be a hassle to remove the stickers that come with them. But if you want to keep your water bottle clean and looking great, it’s important to take the time to remove the stickers. Here’s how.

<h2>Gather Your Supplies</h2>

The first step in cleaning your water bottle with stickers is to gather the supplies you’ll need. You will need:

<ul>
<li>Paper towels</li>
<li>A bucket of warm water</li>
<li>Dish soap</li>
<li>A soft cloth</li>
<li>A mild abrasive like baking soda</li>
<li>A toothbrush</li>
</ul>

<h2>Soak the Water Bottle</h2>

The next step is to soak the water bottle in the warm water. Make sure the water is not too hot, as it could cause the stickers to melt. Let the water bottle soak for a few minutes before you start removing the stickers.

<h2>Remove the Stickers</h2>

Now it’s time to start removing the stickers. Use your fingers or a butter knife to carefully peel off the stickers from your water bottle. If the stickers are sticking strongly, you may need to use a mild abrasive like baking soda to help loosen them.

<h2>Clean the Water Bottle</h2>

Once the stickers have been removed, it’s time to clean the water bottle. Use a soft cloth and a mild dish soap to gently scrub the bottle and remove any residue from the stickers. If there are any hard-to-reach areas, use a toothbrush to get in there and scrub them clean.

<h2>Rinse the Water Bottle</h2>

Once you’ve finished scrubbing, rinse the water bottle with warm water to remove any soap residue. Make sure the bottle is completely dry before you put it away.
