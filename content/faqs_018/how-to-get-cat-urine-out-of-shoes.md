<p>When it comes to pet ownership, cats are some of the most beloved creatures on the planet. However, they can be quite messy, and one of the most common messes they make is leaving their urine on shoes. Unfortunately, cat urine can be incredibly difficult to remove from shoes, especially if it’s been left for a while. Fortunately, there are some methods that can be used to get cat urine out of shoes, and this article will discuss how to do it.</p>

<h2>Removing Fresh Cat Urine from Shoes</h2>

<p>The first step in removing cat urine from shoes is to identify where the urine has been left. This can be done by using a blacklight, which will cause the urine to show up as a yellowish-green color. Once the urine has been identified, the next step is to clean it up. The best way to do this is to use a cloth or paper towel dipped in warm water and mild detergent. Gently scrub the affected area until the urine is removed.</p>

<p>Once the urine has been removed, the next step is to deodorize the area. This can be done by spraying the affected area with a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water. Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes and then wipe it off with a damp cloth. This will help to neutralize the smell of the urine and stop it from coming back.</p>

<h2>Removing Dried Cat Urine from Shoes</h2>

<p>If the urine has been left for a while and has dried, it can be more difficult to remove. In these cases, the best way to remove the urine is to use an enzymatic cleaner. Enzymatic cleaners contain enzymes that break down the proteins in cat urine, which makes them much more effective than regular cleaners. Apply the cleaner to the affected area and let it sit for a few minutes before scrubbing it off. This will help to break down the proteins in the urine and make it easier to remove.</p>

<p>Once the urine has been removed, the next step is to deodorize the area. Just as with fresh urine, this can be done by spraying the affected area with a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water. Let the mixture sit for 10-15 minutes and then wipe it off with a damp cloth. This will help to neutralize the smell of the urine and stop it from coming back.</p>

<h2>Preventing Cat Urine from Getting on Shoes</h2>

<p>The best way to keep cat urine off of shoes is to keep the cat away from the shoes in the first place. This can be done by making sure the cat has a litter box that is easily accessible and kept clean. Additionally, it’s important to make sure the cat has plenty of toys and scratching posts to keep them entertained and away from the shoes.</p>

<p>In addition to keeping the cat away from the shoes, it’s also important to clean up any messes that the cat does make. This can be done by using a cloth or paper towel dipped in warm water and mild detergent. Gently scrub the affected area until the urine is removed and then spray the area with a mixture of equal parts white vinegar and water to deodorize it.</p>
