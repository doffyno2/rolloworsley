Dogs are among the most beloved and loyal creatures on the planet. Many people consider them to be an extension of their family. So, it’s only natural that we want to understand them better. One of the questions that many dog owners have is how often do dogs blink? After all, blinking is a natural part of life for most species, and yet it can look a bit different in animals. Let’s take a look at the answer to this question.

<h2>How Often Do Dogs Blink?</h2>

In general, dogs blink about 10 to 20 times per minute. This is a normal rate for dogs, although some may blink a bit more or less often than this. The blinking rate for a dog can vary depending on the breed, the age of the dog, and the environment they are in.

<h2>Why Do Dogs Blink So Much?</h2>

Dogs blink more often than humans, and this is due to several reasons. One reason is that blinking helps to keep the dog's eyes lubricated and free from dust and debris. It also helps to protect the eyes against wind and other environmental factors. Additionally, dogs may blink more often when they are feeling anxious or scared, and in some cases, they may do this to convey a message to other animals or humans.

<h2>How Can I Tell If My Dog Is Blinking Too Much?</h2>

If your dog is blinking more than 20 times per minute, it could be a sign of stress or anxiety. Additionally, if your dog is blinking one eye more than the other, it could be a sign of an eye infection or injury. If you notice either of these behaviors, it’s important to take your dog to the vet for an evaluation.
