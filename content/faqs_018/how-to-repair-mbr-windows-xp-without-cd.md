<p>A Master Boot Record (MBR) is the information in the first sector of a computer's hard drive. It is used to identify the partition tables for the drive's logical partitions and to boot the operating system stored on the drive. If the MBR becomes corrupted due to virus infection or other reasons, it can prevent Windows XP from booting. Fortunately, there are ways to repair the MBR without a CD, from the command line and from third-party programs.</p>

<h2>Using the Command Line</h2>

<p>One way to repair the MBR on Windows XP without a CD is to use the command line. To do this, you must boot the computer from the floppy diskette and then type the following commands at the prompt: <b>fdisk /mbr</b>, <b>sys c:</b>, and <b>exit</b>. This will overwrite the existing MBR with a fresh one, allowing Windows XP to boot normally. However, this method is not recommended, as it may cause other problems with the hard drive.</p>

<h2>Using Third-Party Programs</h2>

<p>Another way to repair the MBR without the use of a CD is to use a third-party program. There are several programs available that are designed to repair the MBR, including MBRFix, MBRWizard, and MBR Rescue. These programs will scan the hard drive for any errors and then repair the MBR if it is damaged.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Repairing the MBR on Windows XP without a CD is possible using the command line or through the use of third-party programs. However, it is important to note that using the command line can potentially cause additional problems with the hard drive and should only be used as a last resort. Using a third-party program is the safer and more reliable way to repair the MBR on Windows XP.</p>
