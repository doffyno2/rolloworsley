<h2>How Do You Fast Travel?</h2>

<p>To fast travel in WoW, you need to open up your map. You can find this by pressing M or by clicking on the map icon in the top right corner. Once you have opened your map, you can zoom in or out, and move the camera around to find the exact location you want to go to. Once you have found the location you want to go to, click on it and select the “fast travel” option.</p>
