<p>Lizards are common backyard visitors and can often be found sunning themselves on patio furniture. While they may look cute, they can be a nuisance, leaving behind feces and urine, as well as sometimes damaging furniture with their sharp claws. Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to keep lizards off your patio furniture and out of your garden.</p>

<h2>Remove Their Food Source</h2>

<p>Lizards are attracted to areas that have a lot of insects and other small creatures for them to feed on. If you want to keep lizards away from your patio furniture, you'll have to make sure there's nothing around that would attract them to the area. This means eliminating any standing water, trimming back any overgrown vegetation, and removing any food sources such as pet food or bird feeders.</p>

<h2>Block Their Access</h2>

<p>Once you've removed their food source, you should also make sure that lizards can't get onto your patio furniture in the first place. To do this, you can use a fine mesh netting to cover the furniture, or you can use a spray repellant around the perimeter of your patio. You can also use a motion-activated sprinkler, which will startle lizards away when they come too close.</p>

<h2>Use Natural Remedies</h2>

<p>If you want to avoid using chemical repellants, there are some natural remedies you can use to keep lizards away from your patio furniture. One popular remedy is to mix garlic, chili powder, and water and spray it around the perimeter of your patio. You can also sprinkle some cayenne pepper around the furniture, or use citrus-scented oils as a more pleasant-smelling alternative.</p>

<h2>Set Traps</h2>

<p>If your problem with lizards is particularly severe, you may have to resort to trapping them. There are many different types of traps available on the market, ranging from simple glue traps to more sophisticated live traps. Whichever type of trap you choose, make sure to check them regularly and release any trapped lizards at least a mile away from your property.</p>
