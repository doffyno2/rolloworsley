Foxes are common visitors to many backyards, and the presence of a fox can be both a nuisance and a potential danger. Unfortunately, foxes can sometimes take up residence under decking, where they can make a large mess and potentially cause damage to the structure. It can be difficult to remove a fox from its den, but there are several approaches that can help deter foxes from making themselves at home in your backyard.

<h2>Identify the Problem</h2>

The first step in getting rid of foxes from under your deck is to identify the problem. Inspect your yard carefully for signs of fox activity, such as tracks, droppings, or trails. Foxes are nocturnal animals, so their activity may be more pronounced at night. If you hear any noises coming from beneath your deck, it is likely that a fox has taken up residence.

<h2>Eliminate the Food Source</h2>

Foxes are opportunistic feeders, so they may be attracted to your yard if they can find food sources. To deter foxes, make sure to keep pet food, birdseed, and other food items out of reach. Secure your trash cans and compost heap, and keep them away from the deck area. It is also a good idea to keep your yard free of any fallen fruit or other food sources that might attract foxes.

<h2>Habitat Modification</h2>

Since foxes are looking for a safe place to den, you can make your decking area less attractive by blocking off any potential entrances. Use fencing or landscaping materials to block off areas beneath the deck, and make sure to inspect the area regularly for any new openings. You can also try installing a motion-activated light or sprinkler to scare away any foxes that might be lurking in the area.

<h2>Live Trapping</h2>

If all else fails, you can try using a live trap to capture the fox and move it to a more suitable location. Place the trap near the entrance of the den and bait it with food. Make sure to check the trap regularly and release the fox as far away from your property as possible.

<h2>Prevent Future Infestations</h2>

Once you have successfully removed the fox from your decking area, it is important to take steps to prevent future infestations. Make sure to seal up any potential entrances and inspect your yard regularly for new signs of activity. If you notice any new fox activity, take immediate action to deter the animal before it is able to establish a den under your deck.
