<p>Stucco windows are a great way to add an elegant look to a home, but they can be tricky to repair. When these windows begin to leak, it is important to take action quickly to prevent further damage. Fortunately, repairing a leaking stucco window is a relatively simple process and can be done in just a few steps.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Identify the Source of the Leak</h2>
<p>The first step to repairing a leaking stucco window is to identify the source of the leak. Carefully inspect the entire window, looking for cracks, gaps, or other signs of damage. If possible, use a flashlight to look for signs of water intrusion around the edges of the window. If the source of the leak is not immediately apparent, use a hose to simulate a rain shower and look for any signs of water entering the window.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Clean and Dry the Window</h2>
<p>Once the source of the leak has been identified, it is important to clean and dry the area around the window. Use a damp cloth to remove any dirt, dust, or debris that has built up around the window. Then use a dry towel to thoroughly dry the area. Make sure the window is completely dry before proceeding to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Patch the Window</h2>
<p>Once the area around the window is clean and dry, it is time to patch the window. Begin by applying a high-quality waterproof sealant around the edges of the window. Make sure to apply an even layer of sealant and allow it to dry completely before continuing. Once the sealant is dry, use a caulk gun to apply a generous amount of caulk around the edges of the window. Allow the caulk to dry completely before proceeding.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Apply a New Layer of Stucco</h2>
<p>After the patching is complete, it is time to apply a new layer of stucco. Begin by mixing a batch of stucco according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Apply the stucco to the window using a trowel or brush. Allow the stucco to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Finish the Window</h2>
<p>Once the stucco is dry, it is time to finish the window. Use a damp cloth to smooth out any rough edges and make sure the window looks uniform. Once the window is finished, it should be sealed with a waterproof sealant to prevent future leaks. Allow the sealant to dry completely before using the window.</p>
