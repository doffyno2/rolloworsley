<h2>What is a Partial Refund?</h2>

A partial refund is a refund provided to a customer in certain circumstances. It is not a full refund of the original purchase price, but a partial amount. This can be an effective way to resolve customer complaints and disputes, while also helping to maintain customer satisfaction. 

<h2>When is a Partial Refund Appropriate?</h2>

Partial refunds are most appropriate when a customer is dissatisfied with their purchase, but not to the extent that they require a full refund. This could be because the item is not as described, has been damaged in transit, or is faulty in some way. It could also be the case that the customer has simply changed their mind about the purchase. 

<h2>How to Offer a Partial Refund on eBay</h2>

If you are an eBay seller and you want to offer a partial refund to a customer, there are a few steps that you need to take.
