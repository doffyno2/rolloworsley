<p>Images are an important part of a website’s design and layout. They can be used to add visual interest and break up the monotony of text. But if images are not properly sized, they can slow down your website’s loading speed and look distorted on the page. That’s why it’s important to know how to change the size of an image in HTML.</p>

<h2>What is HTML?</h2>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and is used to create web pages. It is the most basic building block of a website and is used to define the structure of a page, such as its layout and content. HTML is a markup language, meaning it is used to differentiate certain elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, and images.</p>

<h2>How to Change Image Size in HTML</h2>

<p>Changing the size of an image in HTML is not as difficult as it may seem. All you need to do is use the width and height attributes of the image tag, which will determine the size of the image on the page. It is important to note that the width and height attributes will not actually change the size of the image file itself, but only the size of the image on the page.</p>

<p>To change the size of an image in HTML, you will need to add the width and height attributes to the image tag, like so: <img src="image.jpg" width="500" height="500">. This will make the image 500px wide and 500px tall. You can also use percentages instead of pixels, like so: <img src="image.jpg" width="50%" height="50%">. This will make the image 50% of its original size.</p>

<h2>Why Is It Important to Change Image Size in HTML?</h2>

<p>Changing the size of an image in HTML is important for two reasons. First, it can help your website load faster. Large images can take longer to load, which can slow down your website’s loading speed. By reducing the size of your images, you can help your website load faster. Second, it can help your website look better. If an image is too large for its container, it can look distorted and unprofessional. By resizing the image in HTML, you can make sure it looks good on the page.</p>

<h2>Tips for Resizing Images in HTML</h2>

<p>When resizing images in HTML, there are a few tips to keep in mind to get the best results. First, always use the width and height attributes in the image tag. This will ensure that the image is properly sized on the page. Second, if you are using percentages to resize an image, make sure to use the same percentage for both the width and height. This will ensure that the image stays in proportion. Third, be careful not to resize an image too small. This can result in pixelation, which can make the image look blurry and unprofessional.</p>
