How to Measure the Face Width for Sunglasses

When it comes to selecting the right pair of sunglasses, one of the most important considerations is the size of your face. The wrong size can make you look silly, while the right size can make you look like a million bucks. That’s why it’s so important to know how to measure the face width for sunglasses.



The first step in measuring your face width for sunglasses is to determine your face shape. There are seven basic face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, oblong, and triangular. To determine your face shape, use a flexible tape measure to measure the width and length of your face. You should measure from the top of your forehead to the bottom of your chin, and from the tip of one ear to the tip of the other. Once you have the measurements, use the chart below to determine your face shape. 

<h2>Oval Face Shape</h2>

If your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all roughly the same width, then you likely have an oval face shape. If this is the case, you’ll want to find sunglasses that are slightly wider than the widest part of your face. 

<h2>Round Face Shape</h2>

If your face is as wide as it is long, and your cheeks are the widest part of your face, then you likely have a round face shape. If this is the case, you’ll want to find sunglasses that are slightly wider than the widest part of your face. 

<h2>Square Face Shape</h2>

If your face is as wide as it is long, and your forehead, cheeks, and jawline are all roughly the same width, then you likely have a square face shape. If this is the case, you’ll want to find sunglasses that are slightly wider than the widest part of your face. 

<h2>Heart Face Shape</h2>

If your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead is the widest part of your face, then you likely have a heart face shape. If this is the case, you’ll want to find sunglasses that are slightly wider than the widest part of your face. 

<h2>Diamond Face Shape</h2>

If your face is longer than it is wide, and your cheekbones are the widest part of your face, then you likely have a diamond face shape. If this is the case, you’ll want to find sunglasses that are slightly wider than the widest part of your face. 

<h2>Oblong Face Shape</h2>

If your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead and jawline are both roughly the same width, then you likely have an oblong face shape. If this is the case, you’ll want to find sunglasses that are slightly wider than the widest part of your face. 

<h2>Triangular Face Shape</h2>

If your face is longer than it is wide, and your jawline is the widest part of your face, then you likely have a triangular face shape. If this is the case, you’ll want to find sunglasses that are slightly wider than the widest part of your face. 



Once you’ve determined your face shape, the next step is to measure your face width for sunglasses. To do this, you’ll need a flexible tape measure and a mirror. Start by measuring from the bridge of your nose to the outer corner of each eye. This will give you the width of your face. Write down this measurement so that you can use it to select the right size sunglasses. 

<h2>Finding the Right Sunglasses for Your Face Shape and Size</h2>

Now that you’ve measured your face width for sunglasses, you can use this measurement to determine which type of sunglasses are best for your face shape and size. Generally speaking, oval face shapes look best in round or oval frames, round face shapes look best in square or rectangular frames, and square face shapes look best in oval or round frames. However, the best way to determine which type of frame looks best on you is to try on a few pairs of sunglasses and see which frames you like.
