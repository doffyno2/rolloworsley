GPS is an important feature for any drone, especially for the Mavic which is designed to be flown with GPS. However, it is possible to fly the Mavic without GPS, and in some cases, it may be necessary. This article will explain how to fly the Mavic without GPS and what precautions must be taken.

<h2>Why Would You Want to Fly Mavic Without GPS?</h2>

The most common reason for wanting to fly without GPS is for stunts or tricks that require precise maneuvering, such as when performing a flip. Another reason is for flying in areas where GPS reception is weak or nonexistent. For example, if you are flying indoors, GPS reception will be very poor or nonexistent.

<h2>Precautions to Take Before Flying Without GPS</h2>

Before you take off, there are a few precautions you should take to ensure a safe and successful flight. First, make sure you are in a wide open space with limited obstacles. You should also ensure that you have a clear view of the sky above you. If you are flying indoors, make sure you have a clear path to the ceiling. Additionally, you should have a spotter to help you keep track of the drone and provide assistance if needed.

<h2>How to Fly Mavic Without GPS</h2>

Once you have taken the necessary precautions, you can begin to fly the Mavic without GPS. To do so, you need to enable the “Manual Flight” mode on the Mavic’s controller. This can be done by pressing the “Mode” button on the controller, then selecting “Manual Flight” from the menu.

Once in Manual Flight mode, the Mavic will be controlled by the movement of the left joystick on the controller. You can use this joystick to move the drone forward, backward, left, and right. The right joystick will control the drone’s altitude, allowing you to hover at a certain height or ascend or descend as needed.

<h2>Tips for Flying Mavic Without GPS</h2>

When flying the Mavic without GPS, keep in mind that the drone will not be able to maintain its position or its altitude on its own. You will need to constantly adjust the left and right joysticks to keep the drone in the air. Additionally, the Mavic will not be able to avoid obstacles while in Manual Flight mode, so you will need to be vigilant and adjust the drone’s movements as needed to avoid any obstacles.
