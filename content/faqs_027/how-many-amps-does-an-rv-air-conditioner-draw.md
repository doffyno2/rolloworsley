How Many Amps Does an RV Air Conditioner Draw?

Having an RV air conditioner can be a great way to beat the heat during a road trip. But before you invest in an RV air conditioner, it’s important to understand how much power it will require. In this article, we'll discuss how many amps an RV air conditioner draws, as well as some tips for reducing the power draw of your RV air conditioner.

What Are Amps?

Before we get into the specifics of RV air conditioners, let’s take a moment to discuss amps. Amps, or amperes, are a unit of electrical current. They measure the amount of electricity that is flowing through an electrical circuit.

In a home, the electrical system is designed to handle a certain amount of amps. For example, a home’s electrical system is usually rated at 200 amps or more. This means that it can handle up to 200 amps of current.

In an RV, the electrical system is usually rated at 30 amps or 50 amps. This means that it can handle up to 30 or 50 amps of current.

How Many Amps Does an RV Air Conditioner Draw?

Now that we’ve discussed amps, let’s talk about RV air conditioners. Generally speaking, an RV air conditioner will draw between 5 and 15 amps. This can vary depending on the size and type of air conditioner you are using.

For example, a 13,500 BTU air conditioner may draw up to 15 amps, while a 15,000 BTU air conditioner could draw up to 20 amps. It’s important to note that the actual power draw of an RV air conditioner will depend on the type of RV you have, the type of air conditioner you are using, and your RV’s electrical system.

Tips for Reducing the Power Draw of Your RV Air Conditioner

Now that we’ve discussed how many amps an RV air conditioner draws, let’s discuss some tips for reducing the power draw of your RV air conditioner. By following these tips, you can help ensure that your RV air conditioner runs as efficiently as possible.

1. Use a Generator: If you are using an RV air conditioner in an area without electrical hookups, you may want to consider using a generator. Having a generator will help ensure that your RV air conditioner runs at peak efficiency, as the generator will provide a consistent power supply.

2. Install a Surge Protector: Installing a surge protector can help protect your RV air conditioner from power fluctuations. This will help ensure that your air conditioner is running at peak efficiency.

3. Turn Off the Unit When Not in Use: If you’re not using your RV air conditioner, be sure to turn it off. This will help reduce the power draw of your RV air conditioner and help ensure that it runs as efficiently as possible.

4. Use a Lower BTU Rating: If you’re looking to reduce the power draw of your RV air conditioner, consider using a lower BTU rating. Lower BTU ratings will draw less power, so they can help reduce the power draw of your RV air conditioner.

5. Choose an Efficient Model: When shopping for an RV air conditioner, be sure to look for an efficient model. Efficient models are designed to draw less power, so they can help reduce the power draw of your RV air conditioner.
