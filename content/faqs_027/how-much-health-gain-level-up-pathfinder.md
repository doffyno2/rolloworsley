Pathfinder is a popular tabletop role-playing game that has been around for decades. It is a complex game with a lot of rules, but one of the most important things to understand is how much health gain level up. Knowing this information can help players make the most of their characters and understand how to best progress through the game.

<h2>What is Health in Pathfinder?</h2>

Health in Pathfinder is a measure of a character's physical and mental state. It is represented as a numerical value, and when a character takes damage or suffers from certain conditions, their health can decrease. When a character's health reaches 0, they are considered dead and removed from the game.

<h2>What is the Default Health Gain Per Level Up?</h2>

The default health gain per level up in Pathfinder is 1d10 hit points. This means that when a character levels up, they roll a 10-sided die and add the result to their hit points. This is the default amount of health gain, though some classes may have special abilities or spells that can increase the amount of health gained.

<h2>What Factors Affect Health Gain?</h2>

There are several factors that can affect the amount of health gained when a character levels up. These include the character's class, their race, their Constitution score, and any special abilities or spells they may have. For example, some classes, such as the druid, have the ability to add additional hit points when they level up.

<h2>How Can I Maximize My Health Gain?</h2>

There are several ways to maximize your health gain when you level up in Pathfinder. The first is to choose a character class that has a high Constitution score, as this will increase the amount of hit points you gain per level up. Additionally, look for classes that have special abilities or spells that allow them to gain additional hit points.

Another way to maximize your health gain is to choose a race that has a racial bonus to Constitution. Races such as dwarves, elves, and gnomes all have bonuses to Constitution, which can give you an extra boost when you level up.

Finally, make sure to use any special abilities or spells that allow you to gain additional health points. These can include spells such as Cure Light Wounds, which can heal you for 1d8 hit points each time you cast it.
