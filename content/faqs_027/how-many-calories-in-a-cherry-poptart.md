<p>Pop-Tarts are a convenient and tasty snack that many people enjoy. But while they’re delicious, they’re not exactly known for being a health food. So, if you’re trying to watch your calorie intake, how many calories are in a Pop-Tart?</p>

<p>First, it’s important to note that the calorie count of a Pop-Tart depends on the flavor. For example, a regular-sized strawberry Pop-Tart has 200 calories, while the same size cherry Pop-Tart has 210 calories. The calories in a single Pop-Tart also depend on the size of the pastry. For example, an XL cherry Pop-Tart has 270 calories, while a mini cherry Pop-Tart has only 90 calories.</p>

<p>In addition to calories, Pop-Tarts also have a number of other nutritional values. A regular-sized cherry Pop-Tart has 4 grams of fat, 34 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of dietary fiber, 10 grams of sugar, and 2 grams of protein. It also contains 20% of the recommended daily amount of calcium, and 10% of the recommended daily amount of iron.</p>

<p>When it comes to calories, Pop-Tarts are similar to other sugary snacks such as donuts and muffins. A regular-sized glazed donut has about 200 calories, while a regular-sized muffin can have anywhere from 250 to 500 calories, depending on the type and size. So, while Pop-Tarts are not the most nutritious snack, they’re not necessarily the worst either.</p>
