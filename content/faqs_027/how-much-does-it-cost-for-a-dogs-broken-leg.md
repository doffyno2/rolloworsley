<h2>What Causes a Dog’s Broken Leg?</h2>

<p>A broken leg in a dog can be caused by a variety of things, including: being hit by a car, being involved in a fight, falling from a height, or having a bone that is weakened by a medical condition such as osteoporosis. It is also possible for a dog to break its leg while playing or running, as bones can be weakened by age or medical conditions.</p>

<h2>Types of Fractures in Dogs</h2>

<p>There are several different types of fractures that can occur in a dog’s leg, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Greenstick fractures – This type of fracture occurs when the bone is bent, but not broken. It is usually caused by a sudden impact or force. </li>

<li>Closed fractures – This is when the broken bone does not protrude from the skin. </li>

<li>Open fractures – This is when the broken bone protrudes from the skin, and is usually caused by a high-energy trauma. </li>

<li>Avulsion fractures – This type of fracture occurs when the bone is pulled away from the muscle or ligament.</li>
