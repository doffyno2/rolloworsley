<p>Houston, Texas is a vibrant and bustling city, full of culture, history, and plenty of attractions. It’s no wonder that so many people are drawn to this city, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States. Unfortunately, this also means that getting to Houston can be a bit of a challenge. Depending on where in the country you’re coming from, driving to Houston can take anywhere from a few hours to several days. So, how many hours does it take to drive to Houston Texas?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on where you’re starting from. If you’re driving from a city relatively close to Houston, such as Dallas or Austin, then you can expect the drive to take about 4 hours.

The best way to figure out exactly how long it will take you to get to Houston is to use a route-planning website such as Google Maps, which can provide you with an estimated drive time based on your starting location.</p>
