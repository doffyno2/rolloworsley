<p>Sugars are carbohydrates that provide quick energy to the body. Many people enjoy eating sugary snacks, like candy and sweets, as a treat.

So, how much exercise do you need to burn off 1 gram of sugar?</p>

<h2>What Is a Gram of Sugar?</h2>

<p>A gram of sugar is a unit of measurement that is equal to one-thousandth of a kilogram. A gram is a standard unit of measurement for all types of food, including sugars. One gram of sugar is equal to 4 Calories, which is the same amount of energy you get from consuming carbohydrates.</p>
