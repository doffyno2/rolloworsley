Hulk, the 183-pound American Pitbull Terrier, is one of the biggest and most beloved dogs in the world. He’s gained fame through his appearances on The Incredible Dr. Pol and other television shows, and his story has been featured in numerous media outlets. But just how much does this gentle giant of a dog weigh?

<h2>What Breed of Dog is Hulk?</h2>

Hulk is an American Pitbull Terrier, which is a breed of dog that’s known for its strength and loyalty. American Pitbull Terriers are descended from a variety of breeds, including the English Bulldog, the American Staffordshire Terrier, and the American Bulldog. They’re considered one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States, and they’re often used for a wide variety of activities, from police work to dog sports.

<h2>How Much Does Hulk Weigh?</h2>

Hulk’s weight is officially listed at 183 pounds. This makes him one of the biggest dogs in the world, and he’s even been featured in the Guinness World Records for his size. Hulk is owned by Marlon and Lisa Grennan, who run the Dark Dynasty K9s kennel in New Hampshire, and they attribute his immense size and strength to a combination of his genetics and his diet.

<h2>How Does Hulk’s Weight Compare to Other Dogs?</h2>

Hulk’s weight is far more than the average adult dog, which typically weighs between 20 and 40 pounds. Even among American Pitbull Terriers, Hulk is an outlier — most adults of the breed weigh between 35 and 65 pounds. But Hulk’s weight is still far below a few other breeds of giant dogs, such as the English Mastiff, which can weigh up to 220 pounds.

Hulk grew very quickly when he was a puppy, and he reached his full size by the time he was just 18 months old. He’s now five years old, and he’s still growing — albeit at a much slower rate. Hulk’s owners believe that he could reach 200 pounds in the next few years, which would make him even bigger than he already is.
