How Much Does An Echocardiogram For A Dog Cost?

Having a pet can be one of the most rewarding experiences of a lifetime. But just like any other living creature, pets can fall ill or experience medical problems. An echocardiogram is one of the best ways to diagnose heart conditions in animals, and can be especially useful for identifying and treating heart problems in dogs.

The procedure is done by placing a small, hand-held device called a transducer on the patient's chest. The transducer sends sound waves into the chest, which bounce off the heart and are picked up by a computer to create an image of the heart.
