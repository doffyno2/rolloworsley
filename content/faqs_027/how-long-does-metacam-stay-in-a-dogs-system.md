<p>Metacam, also known as meloxicam, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is commonly prescribed for dogs to reduce pain and inflammation. It is available in oral and injectable forms, and the injectable form is often used for long-term management of chronic conditions. While Metacam is generally considered to be quite safe for dogs, it is important to understand how long it stays in a dog's system so that it can be administered safely and effectively. This article will provide an overview of Metacam, as well as how long it typically remains in a dog's system.</p>

<h2>What Is Metacam?</h2>

<p>Metacam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used to reduce pain and inflammation in dogs. It is the generic name for meloxicam, and it is available in both oral and injectable forms. Metacam is most often used to treat acute pain, such as post-operative pain, as well as chronic conditions like arthritis. It is important to note that Metacam is only approved for use in dogs, and should not be used in cats or other animals.</p>

<h2>How Does Metacam Work?</h2>

<p>Metacam works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, which are hormones that are responsible for inflammation and pain. By blocking the production of prostaglandins, Metacam can reduce pain and inflammation in dogs. It is important to note that Metacam should not be used to treat infections, as it is not an antibiotic.</p>

<h2>How Is Metacam Administered?</h2>

<p>Metacam is available in both oral and injectable forms. The oral form is typically given as a tablet or liquid, while the injectable form is typically given as an intramuscular injection. The dosage and frequency of administration will depend on the dog's condition and the severity of the symptoms. It is important to follow the instructions of your veterinarian when administering Metacam to your dog.</p>

<h2>How Long Does Metacam Stay in a Dog's System?</h2>

<p>Research has found that the half-life of Metacam in dogs is approximately 24 hours. This means that it takes approximately 24 hours for half of the dose of Metacam to be eliminated from the body. The duration of Metacam in a dog's system will depend on the dose and frequency of administration, as well as individual factors like the size and metabolism of the dog. Generally speaking, most of the Metacam will be eliminated from the body within two to three days.</p>

<h2>What Are the Side Effects of Metacam?</h2>

<p>Metacam is generally considered to be quite safe for dogs, but it is important to watch for any potential side effects.
