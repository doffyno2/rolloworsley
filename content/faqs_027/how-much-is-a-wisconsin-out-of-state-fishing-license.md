<p>Fishing can be a great way to relax and have fun outdoors. Whether you're an experienced angler or brand new to the sport, it's important to make sure you have the right license before you cast your line. If you plan to fish in Wisconsin and you don't live in the state, you'll need to obtain an out-of-state fishing license. Here's what you need to know about getting a Wisconsin out-of-state fishing license.</p>

<h2>What is an Out-of-State Fishing License?</h2>

<p>An out-of-state fishing license is a special type of fishing license that is required for fishermen who are not residents of the state in which they plan to fish. Out-of-state fishing licenses are designed to protect the fish and wildlife in each state, and they are often more expensive than regular fishing licenses. In Wisconsin, out-of-state fishing licenses are valid for one year and must be purchased prior to fishing.</p>

<h2>How Much Does an Out-of-State Fishing License Cost?</h2> 

<p>The cost of an out-of-state fishing license in Wisconsin is $50 for residents of the United States and Canada, and $65 for non-residents. The license is valid for one year from the date of purchase and can be purchased from any licensed Wisconsin vendor. For a complete list of licensed vendors, you can visit the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources website.</p>

<h2>Do I Need Any Other Licenses or Permits?</h2>

<p>In addition to an out-of-state fishing license, you may need to purchase a trout stamp, special access permit, or other permit depending on where you plan to fish. All of these permits and stamps can be purchased at the same time as your out-of-state fishing license. You can find more information about permits and stamps on the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources website.</p>

<h2>What Else Do I Need to Know?</h2>

<p>In addition to obtaining the correct licenses and permits, you should also familiarize yourself with Wisconsin's fishing regulations before you go.
