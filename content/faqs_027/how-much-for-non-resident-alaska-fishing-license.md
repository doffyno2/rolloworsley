This type of fishing license is required for anyone who is not a resident of Alaska and wishes to fish in the state.

Residents of Alaska are required to obtain a separate fishing license, with different fees and requirements. </p>

<h2>How Much Does a Non-Resident Alaska Fishing License Cost?</h2>

<p>The cost of a non-resident Alaska fishing license depends on the type of license and the length of time for which it is valid. A one-day non-resident fishing license costs $25, while an annual non-resident fishing license costs $145. There are also multi-day and multi-year licenses available, with prices ranging from $50 for a seven-day license to $500 for a five-year license. </p>

<h2>What is Included with the Non-Resident Alaska Fishing License?</h2>

<p>When you purchase a non-resident Alaska fishing license, you will receive a physical license card as well as a tag. The physical license card will include your name, address, and the dates of validity for the license. The tag, also known as a “catch record card”, must be carried with you at all times while fishing and must be presented to Alaska Department of Fish and Game officials upon request. You must also possess a valid Alaska Driver’s License or State of Alaska ID card in order to obtain a non-resident Alaska fishing license.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Additional Fees for Non-Resident Alaska Fishing Licenses?</h2>

<h2>What Else Should I Know About Obtaining a Non-Resident Alaska Fishing License?</h2>
