Cooking rice can be a tricky thing. Some people find it difficult to get the perfect consistency and texture. But with the right techniques and the right equipment, you can learn to make perfect rice every time. In this article, we’ll discuss the shallow pan method for cooking rice. 

<h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>

Before you begin, make sure you have the following ingredients:

<ul>
    <li>Rice</li>
    <li>Water</li>
    <li>Salt (optional)</li>
</ul>

You’ll also need a shallow pan for cooking the rice. The size of the pan will depend on how much rice you’re making. 

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Rinse the Rice</h3>

The first step is to rinse the rice. Place the rice in a large bowl and fill it with cold water. Swish the rice around with your hands and then drain the water. Repeat this process two to three times. This will help to remove any dirt or debris that may be present in the rice. 

<h3>Step 2: Soak the Rice</h3>

Once the rice is rinsed, it’s time to soak it. Place the rice in a bowl and cover it with cold water. Let it soak for about 30 minutes. This will help to remove some of the starch from the rice and make it easier to cook. 

<h3>Step 3: Drain the Rice</h3>

When the rice is done soaking, drain the water and rinse the rice one more time. 

<h3>Step 4: Add the Rice to the Shallow Pan</h3>

<h3>Step 6: Cover and Simmer</h3>

Once the water and salt are added, cover the pan and reduce the heat to low. Simmer the rice for about 20 minutes. Do not lift the lid during this time.
