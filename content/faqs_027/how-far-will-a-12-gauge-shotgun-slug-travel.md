<p>Shotguns are one of the most versatile firearms on the market today, and the 12 gauge shotgun is a popular choice for both hunting and target shooting. The 12 gauge shotgun is capable of firing a variety of ammunition, including slugs. Slugs are solid projectiles designed to increase the accuracy and range of the shotgun, and they can be used for both hunting and target shooting. But how far will a 12 gauge shotgun slug travel?</p>

<h2>What is a Shotgun Slug?</h2>

<p>A shotgun slug is a solid projectile that is generally larger than standard shotgun shells. Slugs are made of either lead or copper, and they are designed to be fired from a 12 gauge shotgun.
