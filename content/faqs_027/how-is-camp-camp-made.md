<h2>Gathering the Necessary Gear</h2>

Once the right site is found, it’s time to gather all the necessary gear for the camp. This includes a tent, sleeping bags, a tarp, and other items. It’s important to make sure that all the gear is in good condition and that it’s designed for the campsite. It’s also important to remember to bring extra supplies, such as food and water, just in case.

Additionally, it’s important to make sure that the campers stay on marked trails and stay away from dangerous areas.

<h2>Staying Clean and Healthy</h2>
