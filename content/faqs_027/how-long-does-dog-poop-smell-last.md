<p>Have you ever walked into a room and been hit with a horrible smell? If you’re a pet parent, chances are it was your pup’s poop that was the guilty culprit. While it’s true that all pet poop will smell, the smell of dog poop can be particularly strong. So how long does that smell last? </p>

<p>The answer to that question depends on several factors. Of course, the smell of the poop itself will depend on the kind of food your pup is eating. But even when all other factors are equal, the time that the smell will last will depend on where you dispose of the poop and how much of it there is. </p>

<h2>How Long Does Dog Poop Last Outdoors?</h2>

<p>When you’re out walking with your pup and you have to pick up their poop, you have two choices: You can put it in a bag and take it home, or you can dispose of it in a trash can. If you opt for the latter, you’ll need to make sure that the poop is completely buried. If you don’t, it will start to decompose and the smell will linger until it’s completely gone.</p> 

<p>The amount of time it takes for the poop to decompose will depend on the type of soil that it’s buried in, as well as the temperature of the area. If the area is warm, it will decompose faster than if it is cold. In general, it will take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks for the smell to completely disappear.</p>

<h2>How Long Does Dog Poop Smell Last Indoors?</h2>

<p>When it comes to indoor disposal of dog poop, you’ll need to be even more careful. If you don’t properly dispose of the poop, the smell can linger for days or even weeks. If you’re dealing with a particularly smelly pile of poop, it’s best to put it in a sealed bag and take it outside. </p>

<p>If you do decide to flush the poop down the toilet, be sure to use plenty of toilet paper or a scrubber to get it all down. Otherwise, the smell could linger in your bathroom for days. Additionally, be sure to clean up any poop that your pup has left on the floor or other areas of your home. </p>

<h2>How to Get Rid of Dog Poop Smell</h2>

<p>If your pup’s poop has already caused a smell to linger, there are a few things you can do to help get rid of it. First, be sure to clean the area thoroughly. Use a good cleaner to get rid of any remaining traces of poop, and be sure to vacuum or mop the area as well. </p>

<p>You can also try using an odor neutralizing spray or an air freshener. These will help to mask the smell and will also help to keep it from lingering for too long. If the smell persists, you may want to consider using an ozone generator. These powerful machines will help to neutralize any lingering odors.</p>
