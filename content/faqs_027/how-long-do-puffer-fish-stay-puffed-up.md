<h2>How Long Do Puffer Fish Stay Puffed Up?</h2>

<p>Puffer Fish can typically stay puffed up for up to 2 hours. The length of time that a Puffer Fish can stay puffed up depends on the species, temperature of the water, and the amount of oxygen in the water. Generally, Puffer Fish can stay puffed up for up to two hours, but some species may be able to stay puffed up for longer.

<h2>Why Do Puffer Fish Inflate?</h2>

<p>Puffer Fish inflate for a variety of reasons. They may inflate to appear larger and more intimidating to predators or other fish. They may also inflate to increase their surface area and therefore increase their oxygen intake. Some species of Puffer Fish may also inflate to hide in crevices or other small spaces to protect themselves from predators.

<h2>Can Puffer Fish Inflate on Demand?</h2>

<p>Yes, Puffer Fish can inflate on demand. Puffer Fish can control how much they inflate and how long they stay puffed up. This is because they have the ability to regulate the amount of water or air they drink in. Puffer Fish can also deflate on demand by expelling the water or air.</p>
