Canada is a vast and diverse country that stretches from the Pacific Ocean in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east. As such, it is the second largest country in the world and consists of 10 provinces and three territories. While each of these regions has its own unique identity and customs, they are all part of the larger Canadian family. 

The provinces of Canada are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Each province has its own elected legislature and government, and each is responsible for different areas of governance. 

The territories of Canada are the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon. These territories are administered by the federal government, though each has its own elected representative in the House of Commons. 

Canada is a constitutional monarchy, with the Queen of Canada as the head of state. The Queen is represented in Canada by the Governor General, who is appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister. 

Canada is divided into six time zones, which include Eastern Standard Time (EST), Central Standard Time (CST), Mountain Standard Time (MST), Pacific Standard Time (PST), Atlantic Standard Time (AST), and Newfoundland Standard Time (NST).
