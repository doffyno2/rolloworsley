<p>Most dog owners know that their pup needs regular bathroom breaks, and holding their pee for too long can be uncomfortable and unhealthy. But how long can a dog actually hold their pee overnight? And what can you do to help them if they can’t? Here’s what you need to know.</p>

In fact, it’s best to take them out at least every 8 hours or so to give them an opportunity to relieve themselves.</p>

<p>Younger dogs and puppies usually need to go out more often than adults. Puppies tend to need to pee every 2-4 hours, while young dogs can usually hold it for 4-8 hours. Older dogs may need to go out more often than adults due to age-related health problems, such as incontinence.</p>

<h2>Can Dogs Hold Their Pee Overnight?</h2>

<p>The short answer is that it depends on the individual dog. Some adult dogs can hold their pee for up to 12 hours overnight, while others may need to go out every 6-8 hours. If your pup is a healthy adult and they’ve been able to hold it overnight before, they’re likely able to do it again.</p>

<p>However, if your pup is young, elderly, or has a health condition, they may not be able to hold it for that long. In these cases, it’s best to take them out every 6-8 hours to give them an opportunity to relieve themselves.</p>
