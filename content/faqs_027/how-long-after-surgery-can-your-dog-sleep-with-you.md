<p>Having a beloved pet undergo surgery can be a stressful experience. When your pup is in recovery, you probably want to keep them close and comforted. But how soon after surgery can your dog sleep with you?</p>

<p>After surgery, your pup needs a safe and comfortable environment to recover. Depending on the type of surgery, there may be restrictions on activities such as running, jumping, and playing.
