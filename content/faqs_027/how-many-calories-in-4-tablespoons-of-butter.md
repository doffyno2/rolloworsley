How Many Calories are in 4 Tablespoons of Butter?

Butter is a delicious, creamy dairy product that is used in many recipes to add flavor and texture. But while butter can be a tasty addition to your diet, it is also high in calories. Knowing how many calories are in four tablespoons of butter can help you make better food choices and maintain a healthy diet.



Butter is a dairy product made by churning fresh or fermented cream or milk. It is composed of butterfat, milk proteins and water, and is a semi-solid emulsion at room temperature. Butter has a rich, creamy flavor and is used in cooking and baking to add flavor and texture to dishes.



Butter is a high-calorie food and contains significant amounts of fat and cholesterol. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), four tablespoons (57 grams) of butter contain:

<h2>Calories:</h2>

The USDA states that four tablespoons of butter contain 717 calories. This amount is equivalent to 36 percent of the daily recommended calorie intake for an adult on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet.

<h2>Fat:</h2>

Four tablespoons of butter contain 81 grams of fat, which is equivalent to 124 percent of the recommended daily fat intake for an adult on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet. Of this total fat, 50 grams are saturated fat, which is the unhealthy type of fat associated with an increased risk of heart disease.

<h2>Cholesterol:</h2>

Four tablespoons of butter contain 31 milligrams of cholesterol, which is equivalent to 10 percent of the recommended daily cholesterol intake for an adult on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet.

<h2>Sodium:</h2>

Four tablespoons of butter contain 4 milligrams of sodium, which is equivalent to 0 percent of the recommended daily sodium intake for an adult on a 2,000-calorie-per-day diet.

Despite its high calorie and fat content, butter can be a healthy addition to your diet when consumed in moderation. Butter is a good source of vitamins A, D and E and is also a source of beneficial fatty acids, such as conjugated linoleic acid and lauric acid, which can help reduce inflammation and improve heart health.



Eating too much butter can increase your intake of saturated fat, which can raise your cholesterol levels and increase your risk of heart disease. Too much butter can also lead to weight gain and an increased risk of obesity.



Butter can be used to add flavor and texture to a variety of dishes, including sauces, soups, baked goods, vegetables and meats. You can also use butter as a spread on toast and crackers or as a topping for popcorn.
