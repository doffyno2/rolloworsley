<p>If you’ve recently been shopping for a new television set and have decided on a 65-inch model, you may be wondering how much it will weigh. The answer depends on the type of television you’re looking at, as well as the type of technology it uses and the manufacturer. Here, we’ll take a look at the average weight of a 65-inch TV, and some factors that can influence its weight.</p>

<h2>Types of 65-Inch TVs</h2>

<p>When it comes to 65-inch TVs, there are several different types available. The most common are LCD (liquid crystal display) TVs, LED (light-emitting diode) TVs, OLED (organic light-emitting diode) TVs, and plasma TVs.
