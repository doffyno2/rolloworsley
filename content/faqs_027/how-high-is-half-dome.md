Half Dome is a granite dome located in Yosemite National Park in California, USA. It is one of the most iconic landforms in the park and has been featured in numerous photographs, paintings, and movies. So how high is Half Dome?

<h2>The Height of Half Dome</h2>

Half Dome stands at an impressive 8,836 feet (2,693 meters) above sea level. It is composed of two massive granite slabs that are separated by a steep, narrow ridge, known as "The Diving Board." This ridge is the highest point on the dome and is 1,440 feet (438 meters) above the floor of the valley below.

<h2>Geology of Half Dome</h2>

Half Dome is made of a granodiorite, a type of igneous rock that is formed when magma cools and solidifies deep within the Earth's crust. The rock is light gray to pinkish in color and contains large crystals of quartz and feldspar, along with smaller crystals of mica and other minerals. The granodiorite is estimated to be about 100 million years old, making it one of the oldest rocks in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

<h2>History of Half Dome</h2>

Half Dome has been a popular destination for hikers, climbers, and photographers for over a century. The first recorded ascent of Half Dome was in 1875, when George Anderson and two other men ascended the sheer face of the dome using iron spikes and ropes. Since then, the climb has become a popular challenge for hikers and has been featured in films, books, and magazines.

<h2>Climbing Half Dome</h2>

The ascent of Half Dome is a strenuous hike that requires a permit from the National Park Service. The hike is a 16-mile round trip, with an elevation gain of 4,800 feet (1,463 meters). The last 400 feet (121 meters) of the hike is the most challenging and requires the use of two metal cables that are installed on the steep face of the dome to assist hikers. The cables are typically in place from mid-May to mid-October each year.

<h2>Hazards on Half Dome</h2>

The hike up Half Dome can be an incredibly rewarding experience, but it also presents some unique hazards. The cables are slippery when wet, and there is a risk of rockfall from the steep face of the dome. Additionally, thunderstorms can form quickly in the area, and can bring lightning, strong winds, and heavy rain. Hikers should be prepared for these potential hazards and should pay attention to the National Weather Service forecasts prior to attempting the hike.
