<h2>The Washington Monument's Step Count</h2>

<p>The Washington Monument is made up of 897 steps, leading up to the top of the monument. With the exception of a few platforms, the entire structure is made up of steps.

<h2>The Meaning Behind the Step Count</h2>

<p>When the Washington Monument was first built, the 897 steps had a much deeper meaning. The original design of the monument featured 897 steps to symbolize the first 897 years of American history. The steps represented each year of American history since the first settlers arrived in 1607. The number 897 was also chosen to represent the 897 years since the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776. The 897 steps were a way of honoring the history of the United States and the sacrifices that were made to create the country.</p>
