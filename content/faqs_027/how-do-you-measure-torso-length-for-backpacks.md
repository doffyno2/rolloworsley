<p>For most backpackers, finding the right size and fit is essential to enjoying the outdoor experience. It is important to take the time to determine an accurate torso length in order to find the perfect backpack. After all, backpacks that fit poorly can cause discomfort, injury, and even long-term back pain. So, how do you measure torso length for backpacks?</p>
