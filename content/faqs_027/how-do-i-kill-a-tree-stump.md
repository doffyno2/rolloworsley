<p>Tree stumps can be unsightly, prevent new plant growth, and are difficult to remove. If you’ve recently had a tree removed, you may be wondering how to get rid of the tree stump that remains. There are several methods available to help you kill a tree stump. With the right tools and a bit of effort, you can have a tree-stump free yard in no time.</p>

<h2>Chemical Stump Removal</h2>

<p>One of the quickest ways to kill a tree stump is to use a chemical stump remover. These products are typically made from potassium nitrate and are available from garden centers and online retailers. Before using a chemical stump remover, it’s important to make sure that the tree is completely dead. If there’s any sign of life, you’ll need to use an alternate method.</p>

<p>To use a chemical stump remover, drill several holes in the top of the tree stump and fill the holes with the product. The holes should be spaced out evenly, with each one about an inch or two deep. Once the holes are filled, cover the stump with soil or mulch to help contain the chemical. Water the stump every few days to keep the chemical active and allow it to soak into the wood. After several weeks, the stump should begin to rot away.</p>

<h2>Burning a Tree Stump</h2>

<p>Burning is an effective way to remove a tree stump, however it should only be used if the tree is dead and the area is not prone to wildfires. To burn a tree stump, use a drill to make several holes in the top of the stump. Fill the holes with kerosene or a similar accelerant and light the stump on fire. The fire should burn for several hours, weakening the stump and killing any roots that may remain. Once the fire has gone out, you can use an axe or a shovel to remove the charred remains.</p>

<h2>Digging Out a Tree Stump</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a more manual approach, you can also dig up a tree stump. This option is the most labor-intensive, but it is also one of the most effective. Start by digging around the stump, making sure to loosen all of the roots. Once the roots are loose, you can use an axe or a shovel to remove the stump. Be sure to wear protective clothing and gloves while digging, as the roots may be sharp or prickly.</p>

<h2>Grinding a Tree Stump</h2>

<p>Tree stump grinding is another popular option for removing stumps. This process involves using a machine to grind the stump into small wood chips. Stump grinders can be rented from most home improvement stores, and they are easy to operate. To use a stump grinder, simply place the machine over the stump and start grinding. The machine will grind away the stump and its roots, making it easy to remove the remains.</p>
