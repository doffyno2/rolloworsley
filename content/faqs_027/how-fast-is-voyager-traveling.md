<p>NASA's Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts were launched in 1977. They were the first two spacecraft to explore the outer solar system and the edges of interstellar space. The two probes have since traveled millions of miles, sending back data and images of their journey. But just how fast are these twin space probes traveling?</p>

<h2>Voyager 1 and 2 Speed and Acceleration</h2>

<p>Voyager 1 is the fastest spacecraft ever launched from Earth. It is currently traveling at a speed of about 17 kilometers per second or 38,000 miles per hour. It is currently the farthest spacecraft from Earth, having traveled over 20 billion kilometers since its launch. Voyager 2 is traveling at a speed of about 15 kilometers per second or 33,000 miles per hour. Voyager 1 and 2 are both powered by thrusters which allow them to accelerate, although their speed is still much slower than that of light.</p>

<p>The acceleration of Voyager 1 and 2 is also impressive. Voyager 1 and 2 are both powered by thrusters that can accelerate them up to speeds of up to 10 kilometers per second or 22,000 miles per hour. This acceleration is enough to send the probes out of the solar system and into interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Voyager 1 and 2 Location</h2>

<p>Voyager 1 and 2 are now both located in the outer reaches of the solar system. Voyager 1 is currently located in the heliosheath, the outermost region of the solar system and the edge of interstellar space. Voyager 2 is located in the heliopause, an area of space between the solar system and interstellar space.</p>

<p>Voyager 1 is currently the farthest human-made object from Earth, having traveled over 20 billion kilometers since its launch. Voyager 2 is currently the second-farthest human-made object from Earth, having traveled over 17 billion kilometers since its launch.</p>

<h2>Voyager 1 and 2 Trajectory</h2>

<p>Voyager 1 is currently heading towards the star Acrux, located in the constellation of Crux. It is expected to reach the star in about 40,000 years. Voyager 2 is currently heading towards the star Sirius, located in the constellation of Canis Major. It is expected to reach the star in about 296,000 years.</p>

<p>Both probes will continue to travel through interstellar space, gathering data and sending back images of their journey. They will eventually run out of fuel and drift away, becoming lost in the vastness of space.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Voyager 1 and 2 are two of the most advanced and ambitious space probes ever launched from Earth. They are both traveling at impressive speeds, up to 17 and 15 kilometers per second respectively. They are also both heading towards distant stars, Voyager 1 towards Acrux and Voyager 2 towards Sirius. Despite their age, the two probes are still sending back valuable data and images, providing scientists with an unprecedented look at the outer reaches of the solar system and interstellar space.</p>
