<p>Cherry shrimp, also known as Neocaridina davidi, are one of the most popular shrimp species among aquarists. They are easy to care for, come in a variety of colors, and can make a great addition to any freshwater aquarium. But one of the main questions people have when it comes to keeping cherry shrimp is how long does their breeding cycle last?  </p>

<p>The breeding cycle of cherry shrimp can vary depending on the water temperature and other environmental conditions in the aquarium. Generally speaking, the average breeding cycle of cherry shrimp is between six and eight weeks. However, it is possible for them to breed in as little as four weeks or as long as twelve weeks. </p>

<p>In order to maximize the chances of successful breeding, the water parameters in the aquarium should be kept as close to the ideal levels as possible. This includes temperature, pH, hardness, and other factors. The ideal water temperature for cherry shrimp breeding is between 72°F and 78°F. The pH should be between 6.5 and 7.5, while the hardness should be between 3 and 8 dGH. </p>

<p>The aquarium setup should also include plenty of hiding places and live plants. This will provide the cherry shrimp with the shelter they need to feel safe and secure. It is also important to make sure that there is plenty of food available for the shrimp, such as small sinking pellets, flakes, and frozen foods. </p>

<p>Once the water parameters and aquarium setup are ideal, the female shrimp can be ready to breed in as little as four weeks. During this time, the female will lay her eggs on the aquarium glass or on the plants. The eggs will usually hatch within two weeks and the baby shrimp will be free swimming after another two weeks. </p>

<p>The male shrimp will then begin to court the female and the cycle will start over. The whole process usually takes between six and eight weeks, but can take up to twelve weeks depending on the environmental conditions. </p>

<p>In order to ensure successful breeding, it is important to provide the ideal environmental conditions for the cherry shrimp. This includes having the right water parameters and plenty of hiding places and live plants. It is also important to make sure that there is plenty of food available for the shrimp. </p>
