Bourbon is a type of whiskey that has been distilled for over 200 years in the United States. As one of the most popular types of whiskey, bourbon is made with a mixture of grains including corn, rye, wheat, and barley. It is aged in new, charred oak barrels and is typically aged for at least four years. Bourbon has a distinct flavor that is often described as being sweet and smoky with a hint of vanilla. For many, a good bottle of bourbon is a must-have for any home bar. But how much is a fifth of bourbon?

<h2>What is a Fifth of Bourbon?</h2>

A fifth of bourbon is a bottle of whiskey that contains 750 milliliters, or 25.36 ounces, of liquid. This is the equivalent of five standard drinks. The term "fifth" comes from the fact that, when converted to ounces, the bottle is the equivalent to one fifth of a gallon. A fifth of bourbon is a popular choice for those who want to enjoy a bottle of whiskey without committing to a full bottle.

<h2>How Much Does a Fifth of Bourbon Cost?</h2>

The cost of a fifth of bourbon can vary greatly depending on the brand and quality of the whiskey. A fifth of bourbon from a well-known brand such as Jack Daniels or Jim Beam may cost anywhere from $20 to $35. A fifth of bourbon from a less well-known brand may cost around $15.

For those looking for a more luxurious bottle of bourbon, a fifth of bourbon from a high-end brand such as Woodford Reserve or Maker's Mark may cost up to $50 or more.

<h2>How Long Does a Fifth of Bourbon Last?</h2>

When stored properly, a fifth of bourbon will last indefinitely. This is because bourbon is distilled in a way that makes it resistant to spoilage. As long as the bottle remains sealed, the whiskey will not go bad. Once the bottle is opened, however, the whiskey should be consumed within six months for optimal flavor.

<h2>What Is the Difference Between a Fifth of Bourbon and a Liter of Bourbon?</h2>
