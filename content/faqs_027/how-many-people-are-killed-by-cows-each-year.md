How Many People Are Killed by Cows Each Year?

It’s a statistic that often goes unnoticed, but cows can be surprisingly dangerous. In fact, cows are among the leading causes of death and injury in many countries around the world. But how many people are killed by cows each year?

Cows are usually docile and placid animals, but they can become aggressive if provoked. Cows are large and powerful animals, so even a seemingly harmless encounter can be fatal.

It’s important to take steps to ensure your safety when interacting with cows. It’s best to avoid approaching cows if possible, and try to stay out of their grazing areas. If you must approach a cow, it’s important to do so slowly and calmly. Avoid making sudden movements, and don’t startle or frighten the animal.
