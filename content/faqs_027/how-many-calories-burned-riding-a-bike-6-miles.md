<p>Riding a bike is a great way to get some exercise and burn calories. But how many calories are burned when you ride a bike for six miles? The answer varies based on your weight, how fast you ride, and other factors. In this article, we'll break down the science behind burning calories on a bike ride and explain what factors influence the number of calories burned.</p> 

<h2>Calories Burned Riding a Bike 6 Miles</h2>
