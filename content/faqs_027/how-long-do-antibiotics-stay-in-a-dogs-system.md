Dogs are no different and are prone to bacterial infections that require antibiotic treatment. But how long do antibiotics stay in a dog's system?</p>

<p>When it comes to antibiotics and the length of time they stay in a dog's system, there are a few factors that come into play. The type of antibiotic prescribed, the dosage, and the length of treatment all play a role in determining how long antibiotics stay in a dog's system. As such, it is important to understand the different types of antibiotics and their effects on a dog's body.</p>

These topical antibiotics are often used to treat localized infections, such as skin infections, ear infections, and eye infections. Some of the most commonly prescribed topical antibiotics for dogs include mupirocin, chlorhexidine, and fusidic acid.</p>

<p>There are also injectable antibiotics that are administered directly into the dog's body.
