<p>The human body is an incredible and complex machine, capable of amazing feats of athleticism. One of the most impressive physical feats a person can achieve is running a mile in under four minutes. But how fast can a human run a mile?</p>

<p>The current world record for the mile is held by Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco, who ran a mile in 3 minutes and 43.13 seconds in 1999. That's an average speed of about 13.3 mph, or 21.3 km/h. The fastest mile ever run by a woman is held by Svetlana Masterkova of Russia, who ran a mile in 4 minutes and 12.56 seconds in 1996. That's an average speed of about 11.6 mph, or 18.7 km/h.</p>

<p>But these are world records, and they don't necessarily reflect the average speed of a typical human. For that, we need to look at the average running speed of recreational runners. According to Running Times magazine, the average time it takes an adult recreational runner to run a mile is between 9 and 11 minutes. That's an average speed of anywhere from 5.2 mph to 6.5 mph, or 8.3 km/h to 10.5 km/h.</p>

<p>Obviously, these speeds vary widely depending on the individual's level of physical fitness and training. Elite athletes, for example, can run a mile in less than four minutes, while the average person might take up to 11 minutes to finish a mile. The difference is due in large part to the amount of training and physical conditioning the athlete undergoes.</p>

<p>In general, the faster you run, the more oxygen your body needs to fuel your muscles. This is why professional runners and other athletes train so rigorously - to increase their oxygen intake and increase their speed. The same is true for recreational runners - the more you train and condition your body, the faster you can run.</p>

<p>So, how fast can a human run a mile? The answer depends on the individual's level of physical fitness, training, and dedication to the sport. Elite athletes can run a mile in less than four minutes, while the average person might take up to 11 minutes to finish a mile. But with dedication and training, it's possible for anyone to increase their speed and run faster.</p>
