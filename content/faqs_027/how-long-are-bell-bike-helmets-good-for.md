<p>Bike helmets are an essential piece of safety equipment for cyclists. Whether you're an avid cyclist or just occasionally enjoy biking for leisure, it's important to protect yourself with a high-quality helmet. Bell is one of the leading manufacturers of bike helmets, and it's no surprise why. Bell bike helmets are made with high-quality materials and are designed to last for years. But just how long are Bell bike helmets good for? Let's take a look.</p>

<h2>How Long Do Bell Helmets Last?</h2>

<p>Bell bike helmets are designed to last for several years. However, there are a few important factors that can affect the lifespan of your helmet. These include proper maintenance and storage, as well as the type of helmet you choose. The average lifespan of a Bell helmet is three to five years.</p>

<h2>How To Make Your Bell Helmet Last Longer</h2>

<p>To make sure your Bell helmet lasts as long as possible, it's important to take proper care of it. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Clean your helmet regularly. After each ride, use a damp cloth and mild soap to wipe down your helmet. This will remove any dirt or debris that can cause wear and tear.</li>
  <li>Store your helmet in a dry, cool place. Avoid areas that are too hot or cold, as extreme temperatures can cause your helmet to break down faster.</li>
  <li>Check for damage regularly. Look for cracks, dents, or signs of wear and tear. If you notice any damage, it's time to replace your helmet.</li>
  <li>Replace your helmet after an accident. Even if your helmet doesn't show any visible signs of damage, it's best to replace it after an accident. This is because the internal foam can be compromised, which could affect its safety.</li>
