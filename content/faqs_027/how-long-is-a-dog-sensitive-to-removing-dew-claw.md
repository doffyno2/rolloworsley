<p>Dew claw removal is a common procedure among pet owners, but how long is a dog sensitive to the procedure? The answer depends on a few factors, including the age of the dog, the type of procedure used, and the overall health of the dog. In this article, we will explore all of these factors and provide advice on how long a dog should be kept away from strenuous activity following dew claw removal.</p>

<h2>What is a Dew Claw?</h2>

<p>A dew claw is an extra claw located on the inside of the front legs of most dogs. It can be found above the "normal" toenails, and is usually not connected to the leg in any way. It is often referred to as a "vestigial" claw, meaning that it is a remnant of the claws that the ancestors of modern dogs once had. Most pet owners choose to remove the dew claw because it can get caught on objects and cause pain or injury.</p>

<h2>How is the Procedure Typically Performed?</h2>

<p>Dew claw removal is typically performed as a quick and easy outpatient procedure. The veterinarian will first clean the area around the dew claw and then anesthetize the leg. The veterinarian will then use a scalpel or clippers to cut through the skin and remove the dew claw. In some cases, the veterinarian may use a laser to cut through the tissue and reduce the amount of bleeding.</p>

<h2>How Long is a Dog Sensitive After the Procedure?</h2>

<p>In general, a dog should be kept away from strenuous activity for at least two weeks following dew claw removal. This is because the area around the dew claw will still be sensitive and can easily become irritated or infected if the dog is too active. Even after two weeks, the area should still be monitored for infection and the dog should not be allowed to run or jump excessively.</p>

<h2>Factors that Affect Recovery Time</h2>

<p>The recovery time following a dew claw removal procedure can vary depending on a few factors. Younger dogs typically recover more quickly than older dogs, as their bodies are better able to heal. Additionally, the type of procedure used can affect recovery time. Laser procedures typically result in a faster recovery time than traditional scalpel or clipper methods. Finally, the overall health of the dog can affect recovery time. Dogs with underlying health conditions may take longer to heal.</p>

<h2>What Should I Do After the Procedure?</h2>

<p>Once the dew claw has been removed, it is important to take proper care of the area. The area should be kept clean and dry at all times, and the dog should be monitored for signs of infection. Signs of infection include redness, swelling, and discharge. If any of these signs are present, it is important to contact the veterinarian right away. Additionally, the dog should not be allowed to run or jump excessively as this can cause further irritation or injury.</p>
