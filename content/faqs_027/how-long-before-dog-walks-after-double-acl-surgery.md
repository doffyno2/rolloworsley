We understand how much you want to get your beloved canine back on his feet after double ACL surgery. We’ll provide you with a comprehensive overview of the process, including how long it typically takes before your pup can walk comfortably again.

<h2>What is Double ACL Surgery?</h2>

Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) surgery is a common procedure for dogs. It’s usually done when the ACL is torn or injured. The ACL is a band of tissue that connects the thigh bone to the shin bone. When it’s torn, the dog can’t move his leg as normal.

Double ACL surgery is when both ACLs are injured or torn and need to be repaired. This type of surgery is more complicated and requires more recovery time than a single ACL surgery.

<h2>Preparing for Double ACL Surgery</h2>

Before your pup undergoes double ACL surgery, your vet will perform a full physical examination to ensure that the dog is healthy enough for the procedure. X-rays will also be taken to see the extent of the damage to the ligaments.

Your vet will also discuss the risks and benefits of the surgery, as well as the recovery process and any possible complications. Make sure to ask any questions you may have to ensure that you understand the process and can make an informed decision.

<h2>The Double ACL Surgery Procedure</h2>

During the double ACL surgery, your pup will be under general anesthesia. The vet will make an incision in the knee joint and then use special tools to repair the torn ligaments. The surgery can take up to two hours, depending on the severity of the injury.

<h2>Recovery Time After Double ACL Surgery</h2>

The recovery period after double ACL surgery can be long and complicated. The healing process can take anywhere from four to six months, depending on the severity of the injury.

During the recovery period, your pup will need to take it easy and rest. Your vet may prescribe pain medication or anti-inflammatory drugs to help with the pain and swelling.

<h2>Physical Therapy After Double ACL Surgery</h2>

Physical therapy is an important part of the recovery process after double ACL surgery. Your pup will need to regularly perform exercises to help him regain strength and mobility in his legs.

Your vet may recommend a physical therapist who specializes in canine rehabilitation. A physical therapist can help your pup get back to an active and healthy lifestyle.

<h2>How Long Before a Dog Can Walk After Double ACL Surgery?</h2>

Your pup may be able to start walking on a leash within a few weeks after the surgery, but full mobility may take up to six months. Regular physical therapy and rest are essential to help your pup regain strength and mobility.
