At Midas, we understand that brake repair can be costly and intimidating. That’s why we strive to provide a wide range of services that can fit any budget. So, how much does Midas charge for a brake repair? 

The answer depends on the type of vehicle, the severity of the repair, and the parts and labor required. In general, brake repairs at Midas range from $100 to $800, with most jobs falling in the $200 to $400 range. 

<h2>Types of Brake Repairs</h2>

There are many different types of brake repairs that may need to be performed on your vehicle. The type of repair will have a direct impact on the cost. Common brake repairs include: 

<h3>Brake Pads</h3>

Brake pads are the most common type of brake repair. They are the friction material that helps slow and stop your vehicle when you press on the brakes. Brake pads wear out over time and need to be replaced periodically. At Midas, replacing brake pads typically costs between $100 and $200, depending on the type of vehicle. 

<h3>Brake Rotors</h3>

Brake rotors are the metal discs that the brake pads press against to slow and stop your vehicle. If the brake pads wear out too quickly, the rotors may need to be replaced as well. Replacing brake rotors typically costs between $300 and $400. 

<h3>Brake Calipers</h3>

Brake calipers are the parts that hold the brake pads in place. They can become damaged or worn over time and may need to be replaced. Replacing brake calipers typically costs between $400 and $800. 

<h2>Factors That Affect the Cost</h2>

The cost of brake repairs at Midas will vary depending on the type of vehicle, the severity of the repair, and the parts and labor required. Here are some of the factors that may affect the cost of your brake repair: 

<h3>Type of Vehicle</h3>

The type of vehicle you drive will have a big impact on the cost of your brake repair. Luxury and performance vehicles typically require more expensive parts and more labor, so they will cost more to repair. 

<h3>Age of Vehicle</h3>

The age of your vehicle can also affect the cost of the repair. Older vehicles may require more labor and more parts, so the repair may cost more. It’s important to keep up with regular maintenance on your vehicle to avoid costly repairs down the road. 

<h3>Severity of Repair</h3>

The severity of the repair will also affect the cost. Minor repairs may only require replacing the brake pads, while more severe repairs may require replacing the brake rotors and/or calipers.

The parts and labor required for the repair will also have a big impact on the cost. At Midas, we use only the highest quality parts and a team of experienced technicians to ensure that your brake repair is done right the first time.
