<p>Hot dogs are one of the most beloved fast food items around the world, and it is no surprise that they have become popular in Spanish cuisine as well. The Spanish version of the hot dog is called a "perrito caliente," which literally translates to "hot little dog." This is a very popular and tasty snack that can be found in many places in Spain, and it is quickly becoming a favorite in other parts of the world as well.</p>

<p>Unlike the American version of the hot dog, the Spanish version is usually served in a baguette rather than a bun. This makes it more convenient to eat since you don't have to worry about it getting soggy or messy. The hot dog is also typically topped with different types of sauces, including ketchup, mayonnaise, and mustard. Some regions of Spain even serve their hot dogs with a side of french fries, making it a complete meal.</p>

<p>The most important thing to remember when ordering a "perrito caliente" is to specify if you would like it with or without the sauce. Some people prefer to have their hot dog without any sauce at all, while others like to have it with a variety of different sauces. It is also important to remember to ask for the hot dog without any extra toppings, such as cheese or onions, as these are not typically included in the Spanish version of the hot dog.</p>
