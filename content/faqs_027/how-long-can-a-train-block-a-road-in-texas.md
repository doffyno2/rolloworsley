<p> Texas roads are some of the busiest and most congested of any state in the United States. Keeping the roads safe and clear of obstructions is of the utmost importance for residents of the Lone Star State. One of the major obstacles on the roads of Texas are trains, which often cross roads and block them for long periods of time. So, how long can a train block a road in Texas?</p>

<h2>Train Obstructions on Texas Roads</h2>

<p>In Texas, train tracks are often built alongside roads, and crossing tracks are not rare. These crossings can often be blocked for extended periods of time when a train passes, causing a major obstruction to traffic. This can be especially problematic for emergency vehicles, which may be delayed in getting to a scene due to a train blocking the way. As such, it is important to understand how long a train can be allowed to block a road in Texas.</p>

<h2>The Laws on Train Obstructions in Texas</h2>

<p>In Texas, there are laws that are designed to limit the amount of time a train can block a road. According to the Texas Transportation Code, a train is not allowed to block any road for more than five minutes at a time. If the train is delayed for some reason and exceeds this time limit, the railroad company is liable for any damages or delays resulting from the obstruction.</p>

<p>In some cases, the railroad company may be granted an exemption from the five-minute limit if they can demonstrate that the delay is necessary to ensure the safety of the public or the railroad itself. These exemptions must be granted by the Texas Department of Transportation, and they can only be granted in extreme cases.</p>

<h2>What to Do if a Train Blocks a Road</h2>

It is also important to not try to cross the tracks, as this can be extremely dangerous. It is best to wait for the train to pass, and then proceed when it has cleared the road.</p>

<p>If you find that the train has been blocking the road for more than five minutes, you may wish to contact the railroad company to inquire about the delay. The company should be able to provide an explanation for the delay, and if the delay is unlawful, they may be liable for any damages or delays that have resulted from their obstruction.</p>
