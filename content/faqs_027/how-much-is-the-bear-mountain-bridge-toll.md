For credit card payments, the minimum payment is $2.50 for passenger cars, and $7.50 for commercial vehicles.</p>

<p>The Bear Mountain Bridge toll is collected by the New York State Bridge Authority, which is the agency responsible for maintaining the bridge and collecting the tolls. All of the money collected from the tolls is used to pay for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of the bridge. The tolls are also used to fund other projects in the area, such as road improvements, expansion projects, and bridge replacement projects.</p>
