<p>Betta fish, also known as Siamese fighting fish, are small, beautiful, and very easy to care for. They are a popular choice for home aquariums because of their vibrant colors and small size. Although betta fish have an average lifespan of two to four years, they can live much longer with proper care. But how long do betta fish live when they die?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on several factors, including the type of betta fish, its living environment, and the amount of care it receives. Betta fish that live in good water quality and have plenty of food and exercise will typically live longer than bettas that are kept in poor conditions or are fed improperly. In addition, different species of bettas have different life spans, with some living up to five years or more.</p>

<p>The most important factor in determining a betta's lifespan is the quality of its environment. Betta fish need clean, warm water to survive. If the water is too cold, the betta can become stressed and weak, leading to a shorter lifespan. Poor water quality can also lead to disease and death. Some bettas can live in cold water for short periods of time, but it is not recommended for long-term care.</p>

<p>Finally, some bettas have a longer lifespan than others. Certain species, such as the Veil Tail Betta, are known to live up to five years or more.
