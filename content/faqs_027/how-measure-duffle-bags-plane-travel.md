<p>Are you preparing to go on a trip and have to get your duffle bag ready? Knowing the exact size and measurements of your duffle bag is essential for a stress-free trip. Airline policies and regulations vary, depending on the airline and the size of the bag. This article will explain how to measure a duffle bag for plane travel.</p>

<h2>What Is the Maximum Size for a Checked Bag?</h2>

<p>When it comes to checked bags, most airlines allow for a maximum weight of 50 lbs and a maximum size of 62 inches (length + width + height). This means that the length, width, and height of the bag must all be within these limits. If your duffle bag is too large, you may be charged extra fees.</p>

<h2>What Is the Maximum Size for a Carry-On Bag?</h2>

<p>When it comes to carry-on bags, the maximum size is usually 45 linear inches (length + width + height). This means that the length, width, and height of the bag must all be within these limits. If your duffle bag is too large, you may be asked to check it in.</p>

<h2>How to Measure a Duffle Bag for Plane Travel</h2>

<p>Measuring a duffle bag for plane travel is simple. Before you start packing, make sure to measure the bag first. Here are the steps:</p>

<ul>
