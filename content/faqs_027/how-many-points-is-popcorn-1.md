Popcorn is a beloved snack, enjoyed by many all over the world. But have you ever stopped to wonder how many points is popcorn worth? It turns out that the answer is based on a few different factors, and can vary depending on the type of popcorn and how it is served.

<h2>What Is Popcorn?</h2>

Popcorn is a type of corn that is popped or exploded by heat. It is made up of small, hard kernels that are cooked until they burst and expand into a fluffy, crunchy snack. Popcorn is usually made from either yellow or white corn, though the latter is more popular. It is usually served either salted or with butter, but it can also be flavored with other ingredients such as spices, sugar, and chocolate.

<h2>How Is Popcorn Graded?</h2>

Popcorn is usually graded according to its size and shape. A larger, more uniform kernel is usually considered a higher grade than a smaller, irregular one. The most common grades are light, medium, and heavy. Light popcorn is smaller, with a light yellow color and a light, airy texture. Medium popcorn is larger, with a light yellow color and a fluffy texture. Heavy popcorn is the largest and most uniform, with a dark yellow color and a crunchy texture.
