The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits around the Earth and is visible from our planet's surface. But how far away is the Moon? It's a question that has been asked for centuries, and there are many different answers depending on the context.

<h2>What is the Average Distance of the Moon from Earth?</h2>

The average distance between the Earth and the Moon is 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers). This is the distance from the center of the Earth to the center of the Moon. This is known as the semi-major axis.

<h2>How Far Away is the Moon at its Closest Point?</h2>

The Moon's orbit around the Earth is elliptical, so the distance between the two bodies can vary. At its closest point, the distance between the Earth and the Moon is 225,623 miles (363,104 kilometers). This is known as the perigee.

<h2>How Far Away is the Moon at its Farthest Point?</h2>

At its farthest point, the Moon is 252,088 miles (405,696 kilometers) away from Earth. This point is known as the apogee.

<h2>What is the Difference Between the Perigee and Apogee?</h2>

The difference between the perigee and apogee is 26,465 miles (42,592 kilometers). This difference is known as the lunar librations.

<h2>What is the Distance of the Moon from Earth in Light-Minutes?</h2>

The distance of the Moon from Earth in light-minutes is 1.3. This means it takes light 1.3 minutes to travel from the Moon to the Earth.

<h2>What is the Distance of the Moon from Earth in Hours?</h2>

The distance of the Moon from Earth in hours is 1.3 hours. This means it takes 1.3 hours for light to travel from the Moon to Earth.

<h2>What is the Rotation Period of the Moon?</h2>

The rotation period of the Moon is 27.32 days. This means it takes 27.32 days for the Moon to complete one rotation around its axis.

<h2>What is the Orbital Period of the Moon?</h2>

The orbital period of the Moon is 27.32 days. This means it takes 27.32 days for the Moon to complete one orbit around the Earth.

<h2>What is the Sidereal Period of the Moon?</h2>

The sidereal period of the Moon is 27.32 days. This means it takes 27.32 days for the Moon to complete one orbit of the Sun.

<h2>What is the Synodic Period of the Moon?</h2>

The synodic period of the Moon is 29.53 days. This means it takes 29.53 days for the Moon to complete one cycle of phases, from new moon to new moon.

<h2>What is the Distance of the Moon from Earth in Astronomical Units?</h2>

The distance of the Moon from the Earth in astronomical units is 0.00257 AU. This is equal to 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers).
