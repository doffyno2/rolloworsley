<p>The 380 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), also known as the 9mm Corto or the 9mm Short, is one of the most popular handgun cartridges on the market today. It was developed by John Moses Browning in 1908 and was used by the military in many of its weapons before World War II. The .380 ACP is a rimless, straight-walled pistol cartridge that is more powerful and has more stopping power than most other pistol cartridges. The .380 ACP is a popular choice for concealed carry and personal defense, due to its compact size and low recoil. But how far will a .380 ACP travel?</p>

<h2>Ballistic Performance of the .380 ACP</h2>

<p>The .380 ACP is a relatively low-powered cartridge, so it does not have a very long effective range. The maximum effective range of the .380 ACP is generally considered to be around 50 yards. The bullet will continue to travel further than this, but at distances beyond 50 yards the bullet’s velocity and trajectory will be so low that it will be unlikely to cause much damage. The .380 ACP is generally considered to be an effective self-defense round out to 25 yards.</p>

<h2>Why The .380 ACP Is Popular</h2>

<p>Despite its limited range, the .380 ACP is one of the most popular pistol cartridges for concealed carry and personal defense. This is primarily due to its small size and low recoil, which make it easy to shoot. It is also relatively inexpensive, so it is a popular choice for those on a budget. The .380 ACP is also easy to find and is generally available in most gun stores and online retailers.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of the .380 ACP</h2>

<p>The .380 ACP has several advantages over other pistol cartridges. It is small and light, making it easy to carry and conceal. It also has less recoil than larger cartridges, making it easier to shoot accurately. The .380 ACP also has less penetration than other cartridges, making it safer to use in close quarters. Finally, the .380 ACP is relatively inexpensive, making it an affordable choice for those on a budget.</p>

<h2>The Drawbacks of the .380 ACP</h2>

<p>The .380 ACP is a relatively low-powered cartridge, so it has limited range. It is also less powerful than other pistol cartridges, so it is less effective for self-defense at longer distances. Finally, the .380 ACP is not as widely available as other cartridges, so it may be difficult to find in some areas.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The .380 ACP is a popular handgun cartridge that is well-suited for concealed carry and personal defense. Despite its small size and low recoil, it is not well-suited for long-range shooting, with an effective range of only about 50 yards. It is also less powerful than other pistol cartridges, so it is not as effective for self-defense at longer distances. However, it is small, light, and inexpensive, making it an attractive choice for those on a budget.</p>
