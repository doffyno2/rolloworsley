<h2>How Much Olive Oil Should You Consume Per Day?</h2>

The American Heart Association recommends that adults consume up to two tablespoons of olive oil per day. Studies have shown that consuming more than this amount can be beneficial, but it is important to remember that too much can be unhealthy.
