Space shuttles are some of the most complex and impressive flying machines ever made. They are designed to fly through the Earth's atmosphere at incredibly fast speeds, and they are capable of reaching incredibly high altitudes. For many people, the question of how fast a space shuttle travels per second is a mystery. The answer to this question is actually quite simple and complex at the same time.

<h2>How Fast Does a Space Shuttle Reach Maximum Speed?</h2>

The maximum speed of a space shuttle is determined by its engines and other factors such as wind speed and atmospheric conditions. Most space shuttles can reach up to 17,500 mph, or 28,000 km/h, when all engines are working at maximum capacity. This is the maximum speed that can be achieved by any craft that has ever been sent into space, and it is an incredible feat of engineering.

<h2>How Fast Does a Space Shuttle Travel During Launch?</h2>

During launch, a space shuttle will typically reach speeds of around 3,000 mph, or 4,800 km/h. This is due to the powerful engines that are used to help launch the shuttle into space. Once the shuttle has reached a certain altitude, the engines will be throttled back to reduce the speed. Once the shuttle has reached its maximum altitude, the engines will be shut off and the shuttle will coast through the rest of its journey.

<h2>How Fast Does a Space Shuttle Travel in Orbit?</h2>

Once a space shuttle has reached its desired altitude, it will enter what is known as an orbital trajectory. This is a path that the shuttle will follow around the Earth, and it is determined by the craft's altitude, speed, and other factors. Typically, the speed of a space shuttle in orbit is around 17,000 mph, or 27,000 km/h. This speed is necessary to keep the shuttle in orbit and prevent it from falling back down to Earth.

<h2>How Fast Does a Space Shuttle Travel When Re-entering Earth's Atmosphere?</h2>

When a space shuttle is preparing to re-enter Earth's atmosphere, it must slow down significantly in order to avoid burning up during the process. The speed of the craft during this process is much slower than during launch or in orbit, and it usually ranges between 11,000 and 13,000 mph, or 18,000 and 21,000 km/h. This is still incredibly fast, and it is necessary for the craft to avoid burning up upon re-entry.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the maximum speed of a space shuttle?</h3>
The maximum speed of a space shuttle is 17,500 mph, or 28,000 km/h.

<h3>How fast does a space shuttle travel during launch?</h3>
During launch, a space shuttle typically reaches speeds of around 3,000 mph, or 4,800 km/h.

<h3>How fast does a space shuttle travel in orbit?</h3>
Once a space shuttle has reached its desired altitude, it typically travels at a speed of 17,000 mph, or 27,000 km/h.

<h3>How fast does a space shuttle travel when re-entering Earth's atmosphere?</h3>
When re-entering Earth's atmosphere, a space shuttle typically travels at speeds between 11,000 and 13,000 mph, or 18,000 and 21,000 km/h.

<h3>How much fuel does a space shuttle use?</h3>
The amount of fuel used by a space shuttle will depend on the mission and how long it will be in space. Typically, a space shuttle will use around 2.5 million gallons of fuel for a single mission.

<h3>How long can a space shuttle stay in space?</h3>
The amount of time a space shuttle can stay in space depends on the mission and the amount of fuel it has. Typically, a space shuttle can stay in space for up to 28 days.

<h3>What is the largest payload a space shuttle can carry?</h3>
The largest payload a space shuttle can carry is around 50,000 lbs. This is determined by the size of the cargo bay and the type of mission the shuttle is on.

<h3>How many space shuttles have been launched?</h3>
There have been 135 space shuttle missions launched since 1981.

<h3>How many astronauts have been to space?</h3>
Over 500 astronauts have been to space since 1961.

<h3>What is the purpose of a space shuttle?</h3>
The primary purpose of a space shuttle is to transport astronauts, satellites, and other payloads into space.

<h3>What does it cost to launch a space shuttle?</h3>
The cost to launch a space shuttle mission can range from tens of millions of dollars to hundreds of millions of dollars.

<h3>What is the longest space shuttle mission?</h3>
The longest space shuttle mission was STS-80, which was 17 days and 15 hours long.

<h3>What is the shortest space shuttle mission?</h3>
The shortest space shuttle mission was STS-51-F, which was only 4 days and 19 hours long.

<h3>How many space shuttle launches were successful?</h3>
There have been 134 successful space shuttle launches since 1981.

<h3>What is the most payload a space shuttle has ever carried?</h3>
The most payload a space shuttle has ever carried is 70,000 lbs. This was on the STS-125 mission in 2009.

<h3>How much thrust do the space shuttle engines produce?</h3>
The space shuttle engines produce a total of around 1.2 million pounds of thrust. This is enough to accelerate the craft up to its maximum speed of 17,500 mph.

<h3>What is the maximum altitude that a space shuttle can reach?</h3>
The maximum altitude that a space shuttle can reach is around 350 miles, or 560 km. This is determined by the type of mission and the amount of fuel that the craft has.

<h3>How do astronauts re-enter Earth's atmosphere?</h3>
Astronauts re-enter Earth's atmosphere by using a combination of aerobraking and steering maneuvers to slow the craft down and guide it safely back to the ground.
