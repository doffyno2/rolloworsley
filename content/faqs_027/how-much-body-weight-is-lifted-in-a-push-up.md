<p>Push ups are one of the most common exercises for developing strength and conditioning the body. But how much body weight is actually lifted during a push up? The answer to this question depends on a few factors, including the type of push up, the body weight of the person performing the push up, and the number of repetitions. In this article, we'll discuss these factors in detail and provide an estimate of how much body weight is lifted in a push up.</p>

<h2>Types of Push Ups</h2>

<p>The type of push up you perform affects how much body weight is lifted. Push ups can be divided into two main categories: standard and modified. Standard push ups involve keeping your body in a straight line and raising and lowering your body using your arms. Modified push ups involve changing the angle of your body or using an unstable surface to increase the difficulty of the exercise. </p>

<p>Standard push ups are typically easier than modified push ups, so the amount of body weight lifted in a standard push up will be lower than that in a modified push up. </p>

<h2>Body Weight of Performer</h2>

<p>The body weight of the person performing the push up also affects how much body weight is lifted. Generally speaking, the heavier the person performing the push up, the more body weight is lifted. For example, a person who weighs 200 pounds will lift more body weight than a person who weighs 150 pounds. </p>

<h2>Number of Repetitions</h2>

<p>The number of repetitions also affects how much body weight is lifted in a push up. Generally speaking, the more repetitions you perform, the more body weight is lifted. This is because each repetition requires you to lift more of your body weight than the previous one. </p>

<h2>Estimated Body Weight Lifted in a Push Up</h2>

<p>Now that we've discussed the factors that affect how much body weight is lifted in a push up, we can provide an estimate. Generally speaking, a standard push up performed by a person who weighs 150 pounds will lift approximately 50 pounds of body weight. A modified push up performed by a person who weighs 200 pounds will lift approximately 75 pounds of body weight. It's important to note that these are just estimates and that the actual amount of body weight lifted in a push up will vary depending on the individual and the number of repetitions performed.</p>
