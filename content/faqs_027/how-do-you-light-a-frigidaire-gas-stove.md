<p>Gas stoves are a great way to cook food quickly and efficiently. But, like any appliance, they need to be used correctly to ensure safety and optimal performance. Learning how to light a Frigidaire gas stove is an important step in becoming a safe and efficient cook.</p>

<p>Frigidaire gas stoves come in a variety of models, but the steps for lighting them are the same. The following instructions will help you light a Frigidaire gas stove.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check Your Gas Supply</h2>

<p>Before attempting to light the stove, be sure that your gas supply is on and that your regulator is properly set up. If you are unsure, contact your local gas company for assistance.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Open the Oven Door</h2>

<p>Open the oven door and locate the gas control knob. This knob will be on the oven's front panel, near the top of the stove.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Turn the Gas Control Knob</h2>

<p>Turn the gas control knob to the "light" position. This will open the valve and allow the gas to flow into the oven.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Check for Gas Leaks</h2>

<h2>Step 5: Light the Pilot Light</h2>

<p>Once you have determined that there are no gas leaks, you are ready to light the pilot light. To do this, locate the pilot light near the bottom of the oven. Using a long match or a lighter, light the pilot light. Hold the match or lighter near the pilot light for several seconds, until the flame is lit. Once the pilot light is lit, turn the gas control knob to the "on" position.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Check for Proper Flame</h2>
