<p>The Cleveland Browns are a professional American football team based in Cleveland, Ohio. The Browns compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The Browns play their home games at FirstEnergy Stadium, which opened in 1999, with administrative offices and training facilities in Berea, Ohio. The Browns' official colors are brown, orange, and white. They are unique among the 32 member franchises of the NFL in that they do not have a mascot.</p>

<p>The Browns began play in 1945 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). The Browns won four AAFC championships in their ten years in the league, as well as a NFL Championship in 1950. Following the collapse of the AAFC in 1950, the Browns were absorbed into the NFL, in which they have remained since. The Browns have only had two winning seasons in the past 30 years and have had a losing record in 23 of the last 25 seasons. Since 1999, the Browns have had only two winning seasons.</p>

<p>The Browns are renowned for their loyal fan base, which is among the most passionate and dedicated in the NFL. The Browns hold the distinction of being the only team in NFL history to not have a single winning season in the last two decades. Despite their struggles, the Browns are still one of the most popular teams in the league, as evidenced by their sell-out streak, which began in 1995.</p>

<h2>History of the Cleveland Browns</h2>

<p>The Browns were founded in 1945 by Arthur B. "Mickey" McBride, a Cleveland businessman and football fan. McBride and his partners, Bill Velega and George Halas, purchased the rights to a franchise in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) from the Detroit Tigers. The team was named after the Cleveland's legendary boxer Joe Louis, who was nicknamed "the Brown Bomber."</p>

<p>The Browns were one of the AAFC's most successful teams, winning four championships in the league's ten-year existence. They went on to win the NFL Championship in 1950, their first season in the league. The Browns were led by legendary head coach Paul Brown and Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Otto Graham. The Browns were also one of the first teams to use modern techniques such as film study, scouting, and game plans.</p>

<p>The Browns experienced a period of success in the late 1950s and early 1960s, making three consecutive NFL Championship Games from 1957-1959 and winning the 1964 NFL Championship. The Browns had a number of great players, such as Jim Brown, the greatest running back of all time, and Hall of Fame quarterback Frank Ryan. However, the team began to struggle in the late 1960s, and by 1972 they had only two winning seasons in the previous 20 years.</p>

<h2>The Decline of the Browns</h2>

<p>The Browns continued to struggle in the 1970s and 1980s, and in 1985 they moved to Baltimore and became the Baltimore Ravens. This move was met with much outcry from Cleveland fans, and the team was not welcomed back until 1999, when they were re-established as an expansion team. Since their return, the Browns have only had two winning seasons, in 2002 and 2007.</p>

<p>Despite their lack of success on the field, the Browns remain one of the most popular teams in the NFL. They have sold out every home game since 1995, and their fans are known for their loyalty and dedication. The Browns also have one of the most dedicated and passionate fan bases in the league, and their tailgates are legendary.</p>

<h2>The Future of the Browns</h2>

<p>The Browns have been a struggling franchise for the past two decades, but there is hope for the future. In 2018, the team hired John Dorsey as their general manager, and he has already made sweeping changes to the roster. The team also hired Freddie Kitchens as their head coach, and he has instilled a sense of optimism in the fan base. The Browns have some talented players on their roster, such as quarterback Baker Mayfield, running back Nick Chubb, and wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., and they could be a playoff team in 2019.</p>
