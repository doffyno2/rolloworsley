<p>Tampons are a necessity for many women and are a great way to manage your menstrual cycle. But, they can be a bit confusing to use if you’ve never done it before. One of the most common questions is, "What hole does the tampon go in?".</p>

<p>The short answer is the vagina. The vagina is the opening to the uterus and is located between the urethra and the anus. The tampon should be inserted into the vagina. It’s important to note that the tampon should never be inserted into the urethra or the anus.</p>

<h2>How to Properly Insert a Tampon</h2>

<p>It’s important to insert a tampon correctly to ensure it is comfortable and stays in place. Here are a few steps you can follow when inserting a tampon:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wash your hands with soap and water.</li>
  <li>Remove the tampon from its wrapper.</li>
  <li>Sit or stand in a comfortable position.</li>
  <li>Relax your body.</li>
  <li>Gently insert the tampon into the vagina with the string facing down.</li>
  <li>Push the tampon up to the point where it is comfortable.</li>
  <li>Once the tampon is in place, the string should hang outside the vagina.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to note that it is normal to feel some discomfort when inserting a tampon. If the discomfort is severe or if you experience any bleeding or pain, you should immediately remove the tampon and consult a doctor.</p>
