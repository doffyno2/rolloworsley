<p>If you have a felony on your criminal record, you may be wondering if it's even possible to travel to other countries. While it can be difficult, with proper planning and research, you can still travel internationally. Unfortunately, the answer to the question of what countries can I travel to with a felony is not a simple one. Every country has different rules and regulations, and some countries have stricter policies than others when it comes to allowing felons to enter their borders. </p>

<p>In general, there are a few different scenarios that could occur when a felon attempts to travel to a foreign country. One is that they could be denied entry, while another is that they could be granted entry but be subject to certain restrictions or limitations. This article will provide an overview of what felons need to know when considering international travel.</p>

<h2>Felons and US Passports</h2>

<p>The first thing felons should know is that in the United States, it is possible for felons to obtain a passport. This is possible even if the felony conviction involved a violation of federal law. In order to obtain a passport, felons must first submit an application to the US State Department. This can be done online or by mail. Felons should also be aware that if they are currently on parole or probation, they must obtain permission from their parole or probation officer before applying for a passport.</p>

<p>Once the application is received, the US State Department will review it and make a determination as to whether or not the applicant is eligible for a passport. If the application is approved, the felon will be issued a passport which can be used to travel to any country that the US has diplomatic relations with. It is important to note, however, that some countries may still deny entry even if a passport is held.</p>

<h2>What Countries Allow Felons to Enter?</h2>

<p>In general, most countries will allow felons to enter if the felony conviction is at least five years old and does not involve any violent crimes or drug offenses. However, it is important to note that some countries have stricter policies than others. For example, countries like Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom are more likely to allow felons to enter than countries in Southeast Asia or the Middle East.</p>

<p>Felons should also be aware that some countries may require them to obtain a visa prior to their arrival. This is especially true if the felon is traveling to a country that does not have diplomatic relations with the United States. In these cases, the felon will need to contact the appropriate embassy or consulate in order to apply for a visa.</p>

<h2>What Do I Need to Do Before Traveling Abroad?</h2>

<p>Before attempting to travel abroad, felons should take the time to research the laws of the country they are planning to visit. This will help them determine if they are even allowed to enter the country in the first place. Felons should also make sure to check with their parole or probation officer to ensure that they are in compliance with all of their conditions.</p>

<p>In addition, felons should make sure to carry all of their necessary paperwork with them, such as their passport and any other documents that may be required by the country they are visiting. This includes any visas that they may have obtained. Finally, felons should also make sure to keep copies of all of their documents in a secure place back home, just in case they are lost or stolen while traveling.</p>
