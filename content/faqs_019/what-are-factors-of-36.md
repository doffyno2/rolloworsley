<p>Factoring is the process of breaking down an integer into its component parts, commonly known as its factors. Some numbers, like 36, are especially easy to factor. In this article, we will explain what factors of 36 are, and how to use them in math problems. Read on to learn more!</p> 

<h2>What Are Factors of 36?</h2> 

<p>Factors of 36 are any integers that can divide into 36 with no remainder. In other words, a factor of 36 is any number that can be multiplied together to equal 36. The factors of 36 are 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18, and 36. </p> 

<h2>How to Find Factors of 36</h2> 

<p>To find factors of 36, first divide 36 by 2. If the result is a whole number, then 2 is a factor of 36. Then, divide 36 by 3. If the result is a whole number, then 3 is a factor of 36. Continue this process until you reach the number 1. All the numbers that divide into 36 with no remainder are factors of 36.</p> 

<h2>Using Factors of 36 in Math Problems</h2> 

<p>Factors of 36 can be used to solve many different types of math problems. For example, if you are asked to find the greatest common factor (GCF) of two numbers, you can use the factors of 36 to help you. To find the GCF, list out the factors of each number. In this case, the factors of 36 are 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18, and 36. Then, find the largest number that appears in both lists. In this case, the GCF of 36 is 36. </p> 

<p>Factors of 36 can also be used to solve equations. For example, if you are asked to solve the equation 36x-2=0, you can use the factors of 36 to help you. First, find all the factors of 36. Then, divide both sides of the equation by each factor. If the result is a whole number, then that factor is a solution to the equation. In this case, the equation 36x-2=0 can be solved by substituting x with the number 1. </p> 

<h2>Factors of 36 vs. Multiples of 36</h2> 

<p>It’s important to understand the difference between factors of 36 and multiples of 36. Factors of 36 are any numbers that can be multiplied together to equal 36. Multiples of 36 are any numbers that are multiplied by 36 to get a result. The multiples of 36 are 36, 72, 108, 144, and so on. </p> 

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 

<p>Factors of 36 are any numbers that can be multiplied together to equal 36. These factors are 1,2,3,4,6,9,12,18, and 36. Factors of 36 can be used to solve equations, find the greatest common factor, and more. It’s important to understand the difference between factors of 36 and multiples of 36. Factors of 36 are any numbers that can be multiplied together to equal 36, while multiples of 36 are any numbers that are multiplied by 36 to get a result. </p>
