<p>Are you looking for a way to stay in shape, but can't decide whether you should walk or bike to do so? It's a great question and one that has divided people for years. While both walking and biking are great ways to get exercise and burn calories, there are some differences between the two forms of exercise. In this article, we will look at both walking and biking to determine which one burns more calories.</p>

<h2>Calorie Burning Basics</h2>

<p>The amount of calories burned during any physical activity depends on several factors, including the intensity and duration of the activity, the person's body weight, and the person's age. When it comes to walking and biking, the intensity of the activity will also play a role in how many calories you burn.</p>

<h2>Calories Burned Walking</h2>

<p>When it comes to walking, the average person will burn roughly 100 calories per mile, depending on the intensity of their walking. If you increase the intensity of your walking, you can burn more calories per mile. For example, if you walk at a brisk pace, you can burn up to 150 calories per mile. If you power walk or run, you can burn up to 200 calories per mile.</p>

<h2>Calories Burned Biking</h2>

<p>When it comes to biking, the average person will burn roughly 200 calories per mile. This number is higher than walking because biking is a more intense form of exercise. The intensity of your biking can also affect the amount of calories you burn. For example, if you bike at a leisurely pace, you can burn up to 150 calories per mile. If you bike at a more intense pace, you can burn up to 250 calories per mile.</p>

<h2>Which Burns More Calories?</h2>

<p>Now that we have looked at the amount of calories burned when walking and biking the same distance, we can conclude that biking burns more calories than walking. This is due to the intensity of the activity and the fact that biking is a more efficient way to travel. Biking will also help you reach your fitness goals faster than walking, as you will be burning more calories in a shorter amount of time.</p>

<h2>Additional Benefits of Walking</h2>

<p>While biking may burn more calories than walking, walking still has its benefits. Walking is a low-impact form of exercise and is a great way to stay in shape without putting too much strain on your body. It is also a great way to get some fresh air and enjoy the outdoors. Walking can also help reduce stress and improve your overall mental health.</p>

<h2>Additional Benefits of Biking</h2>

<p>Biking is a great way to get some exercise and burn a lot of calories in a short amount of time. Biking is also a great way to explore your surroundings and travel to different places. Additionally, biking is great for the environment, as it does not produce any emissions. Biking is also a great way to spend time with friends and family.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When it comes to burning calories, biking is the more efficient choice. However, both walking and biking are great ways to stay in shape and have their own unique benefits. We recommend that you mix up your routine and incorporate both walking and biking into your workout regimen. This will help you reach your fitness goals faster and keep your body healthy.</p>
