For women, finding the perfect bra size can be a challenge. Figuring out what the numbers and letters mean, and how to convert them from one sizing system to another, can be confusing. Fortunately, learning the basics of bra measurement and understanding the sizing systems used by different lingerie brands can make the process of finding the right fit much easier. 

<h2>How Bra Measurements Work</h2>

A bra size includes two measurements: the band size and the cup size. The band size is determined by measuring around the rib cage, just below the breasts. To get the cup size, the measurement is taken at the fullest part of the bust, usually across the nipples. The difference between the two measurements will determine the cup size. 

<h3>Converting to Other Sizing Systems</h3>

The most commonly used bra sizing system in the United States is the one used by most lingerie brands, which is based on a combination of inches and letters. For example, a 34B bra size means the band size is 34 inches and the cup size is B. Other sizing systems may use centimeters, or a combination of numbers and letters, such as 80C. To convert from one sizing system to another, simply use an online converter, such as the one provided by HerRoom. 

<h3>Variations in Sizing</h3>

It is important to note that bra sizes can vary slightly from one brand to another. For example, a 34B bra size from one brand may not fit the same as a 34B bra size from another brand. It is best to try on a few different sizes to make sure you get the best fit. Additionally, it is important to be aware that as your body changes, so may your bra size. Weight fluctuations, pregnancy, and other factors may all affect your bra size over time. 

<h3>Understanding the Cup Size</h3>

The cup size is determined by the difference between the band size and the bust measurement. Generally, each inch of difference corresponds to one cup size. For example, a woman with a 36 inch band size and a 37 inch bust measurement would be a 36B. For cup sizes larger than a D, many brands will use double letters, such as DD or E. 

<h3>Finding the Right Fit</h3>

In addition to measuring correctly, it is also important to make sure that the bra fits properly. The band should be snug, but not too tight. The cups should cover the entire bust without leaving any gaps. The straps should not dig into the shoulders, and the center of the bra should rest flat against the chest.
