Salmon is one of the most popular fish types around the world, and for good reason. It is an incredibly nutritious food, providing a wide range of essential vitamins and minerals. It is also a rich source of omega-3 fatty acids, which can help reduce the risk of heart disease, stroke, and other health issues. But, is it possible to eat too much salmon?

<h2>Nutritional Benefits Of Salmon</h2>

Salmon is a great source of protein, providing around 22 grams of protein per 3.5 ounces (100 grams) of cooked fish. It is also rich in healthy omega-3 fatty acids, with around 1.9 grams of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids per 3.5 ounces (100 grams).

It is important to note that these recommendations are based on average-sized portions. If you are consuming larger portions, then you should adjust your intake accordingly. 

<h2>Other Nutritional Considerations</h2>

In addition to limiting your salmon intake, it is also important to make sure that you are eating a balanced diet. Salmon is a nutritious food, but it should not be the only source of nutrients in your diet.
