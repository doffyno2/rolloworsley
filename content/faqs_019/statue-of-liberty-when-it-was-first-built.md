Statue of Liberty – When It Was First Built

The Statue of Liberty is one of the most iconic symbols of the United States and is located in the New York Harbor. It was a gift from France to the United States in 1886, and has since become a symbol of freedom and democracy around the world. But what do we know about the Statue of Liberty’s origins and the moment when it was first built? Let’s take a look:

<h2>The Origins of the Statue of Liberty</h2>
The Statue of Liberty was designed by French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi. In 1871, Bartholdi set out to build a monument to serve as a symbol of freedom and friendship between the United States and France. After visiting the United States and touring the East Coast, Bartholdi chose Bedloe’s Island (now known as Liberty Island) as the site of the monument. The island was chosen because it was visible from the New York Harbor and served as a gateway to the United States.

Bartholdi began working on the Statue of Liberty in 1875. He designed the monument to be a colossal neoclassical sculpture with a female figure wearing a robe and holding a torch. The design was inspired by the Roman goddess Libertas and was meant to symbolize freedom and democracy.

<h2>The Building of the Statue of Liberty</h2>

The Statue of Liberty was a massive undertaking and required the help of hundreds of people to be built. In 1877, Bartholdi began working with French engineer Gustave Eiffel, who was responsible for the design of the internal structure of the monument. The monument was constructed from copper sheets that were hammered and shaped by hand. The copper sheets were then assembled into a skeleton frame that was constructed on a wooden platform.

The Statue of Liberty was completed in 1884 and was then disassembled and shipped to the United States in crates. The monument was reassembled on Bedloe’s Island and was officially dedicated on October 28, 1886.

<h2>The Impact of the Statue of Liberty</h2>

Since the moment when it was first built, the Statue of Liberty has become a symbol of freedom and democracy around the world. It has become an iconic image of the United States and is a popular tourist destination. The Statue of Liberty is also featured on the American penny, the American flag, and the United States Seal.

The Statue of Liberty is more than just a symbol of freedom and democracy. For many immigrants coming to the United States, the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of hope and a reminder of the possibilities that life in the United States offers.
