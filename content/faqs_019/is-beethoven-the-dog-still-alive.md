<h2>The First Movie</h2>

<p>Beethoven first made his debut in the 1992 family comedy, Beethoven. The movie follows the Newton family as they adopt a giant St. Bernard puppy, who quickly takes over the family’s lives. Despite the chaos he causes, the family eventually comes to love the mischievous pup and the movie ends with a happy ending.</p>

The first sequel, Beethoven’s 2nd, was released in 1993 and follows the Newton family as they adopt a female St. Bernard and try to keep her out of trouble. Beethoven’s 3rd came out in 2000, followed by Beethoven’s 4th in 2001 and Beethoven’s 5th in 2003. All five movies were directed by Brian Levant. </p>
