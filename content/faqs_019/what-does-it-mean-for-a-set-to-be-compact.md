<p>In mathematics, a set is a collection of distinct objects, usually numbers. Sets are one of the fundamental objects of study in mathematics and are widely used in all branches of mathematics. Sets can be classified in various ways, one of which is by their “compactness”. So, what does it mean for a set to be compact?</p>

<p>A set is said to be compact if it is closed and bounded. This means that the set contains all of its limit points. A limit point is a point in the set such that a sequence of points in the set converges to it. For example, if we consider the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then the limit point of this set is 5, since a sequence of points in the set, such as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5}, converges to 5. On the other hand, if the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} is considered, then the limit point of this set is 6, since a sequence of points in the set, such as {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6}, converges to 6.</p>

<p>A set is also said to be bounded if there exists a real number such that all elements of the set are less than that real number. For example, the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} is bounded by 6, since all elements of the set are less than 6. Similarly, the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} is bounded by 12, since all elements of the set are less than 12.</p>

<p>A set is said to be closed if it contains all its limit points. This means that if a sequence of points in the set converges to a point, then that point is also in the set. For example, if we consider the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, then it is closed since the sequence {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5} converges to 5 and 5 is in the set. Similarly, if the set {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} is considered, then it is also closed since the sequence {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10} converges to 10 and 10 is in the set.</p>

<p>In summary, a set is said to be compact if it is closed and bounded. This means that the set contains all of its limit points and that there exists a real number such that all elements of the set are less than that real number. Compact sets are very important in mathematics and are used in many fields including topology, optimization and calculus.</p>

<h3>Can a set be both closed and open?</h3>
<p>No, a set cannot be both closed and open. A set is either closed or open.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between a compact set and a bounded set?</h3>
<p>The difference between a compact set and a bounded set is that a compact set is both closed and bounded whereas a bounded set is just bounded.</p>

<h3>Are compact sets finite?</h3>
<p>No, compact sets can be finite or infinite.</p>

<h3>What is the difference between a compact set and a discrete set?</h3>
<p>The difference between a compact set and a discrete set is that a compact set is closed and bounded whereas a discrete set is not necessarily closed or bounded.</p>
