<h2>What is a Samsung Phone Flashlight?</h2>

A Samsung phone flashlight is a feature on all Samsung phones that allows you to use the phone’s LED flash as a flashlight. It is a convenient way to light up dark areas or to find items in the dark.

<h2>Steps for Turning Off a Samsung Phone Flashlight</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Open the Notifications Panel</h3>

To begin turning off the flashlight, you will need to open the notifications panel. To do this, swipe down from the top of your phone’s display. This will open the notifications panel, which contains all of your phone’s settings and information.

<h3>Step 2: Locate the Flashlight Icon</h3>
