Airwalk was once one of the most popular skateboarding and lifestyle brands in the world. Founded in 1986, Airwalk quickly became a leader in the action sports industry and made a name for itself as the go-to brand for skaters. But where did Airwalk go?

<h2>The Rise of Airwalk</h2>

Airwalk was founded in 1986 by professional skateboarder Jeff Haskell. At the time, skateboarding was still in its infancy and there were few brands catering to the growing sport. Seeing an opportunity, Haskell decided to launch his own brand and Airwalk was born. 

Initially, Airwalk focused on producing high-quality skateboard shoes. The brand quickly won over fans with its stylish designs and durable construction. As the skateboarding trend gained momentum, Airwalk was at the forefront of the movement.

<h2>Airwalk Goes Global</h2>

As Airwalk’s popularity grew, the brand expanded into other markets. In the early 1990s, Airwalk began producing apparel and accessories such as t-shirts, hats, backpacks, and bags. This allowed the brand to reach an even wider audience and gain a global following. 

Airwalk also began sponsoring professional skateboarders and other action sports athletes. This helped to further cement Airwalk’s reputation as a leader in the industry and established the brand as a household name. 

<h2>The Decline of Airwalk</h2>

By the late 1990s, Airwalk had become one of the most iconic skateboard and lifestyle brands in the world. Unfortunately, the brand’s success was short-lived. In 1998, Airwalk was acquired by the footwear giant, Collective Brands. Collective Brands began to shift the focus away from skateboarding and towards more mainstream markets. 

The new owners also decided to cut back on marketing and sponsorship spending. This had a negative effect on the brand’s image as it began to become less relevant to the skateboarding community. Airwalk’s popularity began to wane and the brand slowly faded from the spotlight. 

<h2>Airwalk Today</h2>

Today, Airwalk still exists but the brand is a shadow of its former self. The brand has lost much of its relevance in the skateboarding community and is now mainly found in discount stores and outlets. Despite its decline, Airwalk still has a loyal fan base who remember the brand’s heyday and are willing to keep its legacy alive.
