It’s also important to consider the width of your child’s foot. While most shoe sizes come in standard widths, some brands offer wider widths for kids. If your child has wide feet, you may need to buy a size up to accommodate the width. 

Finally, it’s important to consider the activity your child will be wearing the shoes for. If your child is active and plays sports, you may want to buy shoes designed specifically for that sport. This will ensure that they have the support and protection they need to stay safe and comfortable while they play.
