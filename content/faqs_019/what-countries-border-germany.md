<h2>Why Are Borders So Important?</h2>

Borders are important for many reasons. They help to define the identity of a nation, they provide a physical and legal boundary between countries, and they provide an opportunity for countries to cooperate on matters such as trade and immigration. Borders also help to protect a nation's sovereignty and ensure that its citizens are safe and secure. Borders serve as a reminder that every nation has its own unique culture, customs, and laws.
