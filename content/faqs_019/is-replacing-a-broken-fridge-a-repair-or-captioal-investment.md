<p>When you’ve got a broken fridge, you have a few options: you can try to repair it, replace it, or just suffer through. But which option is best? Is replacing a broken fridge a repair or a capital investment?</p>

<p>The answer isn’t always straightforward. It depends on the type and age of your fridge, the severity of the problem, and whether you’re willing to make a major financial commitment. Let’s take a look at all the factors that go into determining whether replacing a broken fridge is a repair or a capital investment.</p>

<h2>The Type of Fridge</h2>

<p>The type of fridge you have will play a big role in determining whether replacing it is a repair or a capital investment. Generally speaking, if you have an older model or a basic, no-frills fridge, it’s likely a repair. On the other hand, if you have a high-end model with lots of features, it’s likely a capital investment.</p>

<p>For example, if you have an old top-freezer fridge, it’s likely a repair. But if you have a newer model with an ice maker and water dispenser, it’s likely a capital investment.</p>

<h2>The Severity of the Problem</h2>

<p>The severity of the problem your fridge is experiencing will also play a role in determining whether replacing it is a repair or a capital investment. If the problem is minor and can be easily fixed, it’s likely a repair. But if the problem is major and requires extensive repairs, it’s likely a capital investment.</p>

<p>For example, if your fridge is leaking water, it’s likely a repair. But if your compressor is broken, it’s likely a capital investment.</p>

<h2>Your Financial Commitment</h2>

<p>Finally, the amount of money you’re willing to spend will also play a role in determining whether replacing a broken fridge is a repair or a capital investment. If you’re only willing to spend a little bit of money on repairs, it’s likely a repair. But if you’re willing to make a major financial commitment, it’s likely a capital investment.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re only willing to spend $100 on repairs, it’s likely a repair. But if you’re willing to spend $1,000 or more on a new fridge, it’s likely a capital investment.</p>
