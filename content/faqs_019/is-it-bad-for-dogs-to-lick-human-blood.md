<p>Your loyal and beloved canine companion may love to give you lots of slobbery kisses, but is it bad for dogs to lick human blood? While it’s not a common occurrence, it’s still something that pet owners should be aware of and understand. In this article, we’ll help you understand why dogs might be licking human blood, what the risks are, and what you can do to discourage this behavior.</p>

<h2>Why Do Dogs Lick Human Blood?</h2>

<p>The most common reason why a dog may be licking human blood is because they are drawn to the smell. Dogs have an incredibly strong sense of smell and can detect the presence of blood from a great distance. In addition, the saltiness of the blood may be appealing to them. This can be especially true if the blood is from an open wound.</p>

<p>In some cases, dogs may lick human blood out of curiosity. This is especially true of young puppies who are exploring their environment and discovering new things. It’s important to remember that licking is a normal canine behavior, so it’s likely that your pup is just curious and exploring.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that your dog may be trying to comfort you. Dogs are very intuitive creatures and may be trying to show you that they understand that something is wrong and that they are there for you. This can be especially true if there is an open wound or cut that your pup is trying to lick.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of a Dog Licking Human Blood?</h2>

<p>The most immediate risk of a dog licking human blood is the risk of infection. Dogs have bacteria in their saliva that can cause infection if it gets into an open wound. This can lead to redness, swelling, and pain. In some cases, it can even lead to more serious infections such as sepsis.</p>

<p>Additionally, dogs can also transmit viruses and other pathogens through their saliva. This can include things like parvovirus, distemper, and hepatitis. So, even if your pup isn’t infected with anything, they can still transmit these viruses to you if they are licking your blood.</p>

<p>Finally, licking human blood can also be a sign of stress or anxiety in your pup. If your pup is feeling anxious or stressed, it may be trying to self-soothe by licking human blood. This can be a sign that your pup is in need of some extra love and attention.</p>

<h2>How to Discourage Dogs from Licking Human Blood</h2>

<p>The best way to discourage your pup from licking human blood is to address the underlying cause. If your pup is licking out of curiosity or boredom, be sure to provide plenty of mental stimulation and enrichment activities for them to do. This can include things like puzzle toys, training sessions, and playtime.</p>

<p>If your pup is licking out of stress or anxiety, be sure to provide extra attention and affection. You can also consider using calming techniques such as pheromone diffusers or calming treats. Additionally, if you notice that your pup is licking out of fear or anxiety, it’s important to address the underlying cause of the fear or anxiety as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s also important to address any open wounds or cuts that your pup may be licking.
