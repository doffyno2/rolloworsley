Prairie dogs are small, burrowing rodents that are native to the North American prairie eco-system. They are a popular game animal, and as such, they require the right type of gun to hunt them. In this article, we will discuss what type of gun is best for hunting prairie dogs, as well as some tips on how to successfully hunt them.

<h2>What Type of Gun is Best for Hunting Prairie Dogs?</h2>

When it comes to choosing the best gun for hunting prairie dogs, there are a few factors to consider. The first is the type of action the gun has. Prairie dog guns are typically bolt-action rifles, as they are more accurate and have a higher rate of fire. This makes them ideal for quickly taking out prairie dogs in a single shot.

The second factor to consider is the caliber of the gun. The most common caliber for prairie dog guns is .17 HMR (Hornady Magnum Rimfire). This caliber is lightweight and has enough power to take out prairie dogs from a distance. Some hunters also prefer .22 LR (Long Rifle) for their prairie dog guns, as it has a longer effective range than .17 HMR.

Finally, the type of barrel is important when selecting a prairie dog gun. A bull barrel is ideal for prairie dog hunting as it is lightweight and has a longer range. Bull barrels are also more accurate and have less recoil than other types of barrels.

5. Make sure to bring a good supply of ammunition. Having a good supply of ammunition is important for successful prairie dog hunting. The more shots that can be taken, the more chances there are for a successful hunt.
