<p>Using a cup is a great way to protect your body from injury during physical activity. But if you’ve never worn one before, it can be a bit intimidating. Don’t worry—wearing a cup is relatively simple, and this guide will teach you everything you need to know.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Cup</h2>

<p>The first step in wearing a cup is selecting the right cup for you. There are several different types of cups available, and the type you choose should depend on the activity you’ll be doing. Here are some of the most popular types of cups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Plastic cups: Plastic cups are lightweight and inexpensive, making them a good choice for recreational athletes. They also come in a range of sizes, so you can find one that fits comfortably.</li>
  <li>Rubber cups: Rubber cups are more durable than plastic cups and are better suited for more intense activities. They are also better at absorbing shock, so they can provide more protection.</li>
  <li>Leather cups: Leather cups are the most expensive type of cup, but they offer the best protection. They are also the most comfortable option, so they’re a good choice for athletes who are looking for maximum protection and comfort.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Putting on the Cup</h2>

<p>Once you’ve chosen the right cup, it’s time to put it on. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Start by cleaning the cup with warm, soapy water. This will help ensure that the cup is clean and free of any dirt or debris.</li>
  <li>Next, slide the cup up your body until it sits comfortably against your groin area.</li>
  <li>Once the cup is in place, adjust the straps so that it fits snugly against your body.</li>
  <li>Finally, adjust the straps so that the cup is firmly in place. The cup should not move or shift around when you move.</li>
</ol>
