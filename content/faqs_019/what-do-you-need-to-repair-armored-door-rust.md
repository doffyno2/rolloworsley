<h2>What Causes Armored Door Rust?</h2>
 
Armored doors are often made of steel, which is prone to rust due to its exposure to moisture, dirt and other elements in the environment. Rust can form on any steel surface that is not properly cared for and is exposed to the elements. This can cause the door to wear down and become vulnerable to damage.

Rust can also form on the door due to improper maintenance. When the steel is not regularly cleaned and lubricated, it can become corroded and weakened, leading to rust formation. The rust can weaken the steel, making it more susceptible to damage.

<h2>How to Prevent Armored Door Rust</h2>

The best way to prevent rust from forming on an armored door is to keep it clean and lubricated. Regularly inspect the door for signs of rust and clean it with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Make sure to dry the door thoroughly after cleaning to prevent moisture from being trapped in the steel and causing further corrosion.

In addition, it's important to lubricate the door regularly. Use a lubricant specifically designed for steel, such as a silicone lubricant, and apply it to the hinges and other moving parts. This will prevent rust from forming and keep the door functioning properly.

<h2>How to Repair Armored Door Rust</h2>

If rust has already formed on an armored door, there are a few methods to repair it. The first step is to remove the rust by using a wire brush or steel wool. Use the wire brush or steel wool to scrub away the rust until the steel is exposed.

Once the rust has been removed, use a rust-inhibiting primer to protect the steel and prevent further rusting. Allow the primer to dry completely before applying a top coat of paint to match the existing color of the door.

Finally, lubricate the door with a silicone lubricant or other steel-specific lubricant. This will help keep the door rust-free and functioning properly.
