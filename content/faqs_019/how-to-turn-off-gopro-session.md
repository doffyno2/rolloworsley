<p>GoPro session is the latest camera from GoPro that is used by users for recording videos and taking photos. It is small, lightweight and extremely easy to use. It is also very versatile, allowing users to record in different resolutions and frame rates, and to even transfer the media files directly to the computer for further editing and post-production work. However, it is also important for users to know how to turn off the GoPro session, so that they can save battery life and prevent any accidental recordings.</p>

<h2>Charging the Battery</h2>

<p>Before turning off the GoPro session, it is important to make sure that the battery is fully charged. This can be done by connecting the camera to a power source, such as a laptop, charger or power bank. Once the camera is fully charged, the battery icon on the LCD screen will turn green. This means that the camera is ready for use.</p>

<h2>Powering On and Off the Camera</h2>

<p>The camera can be powered on and off by pressing and holding the power button for 3 seconds. The camera will emit a beep to indicate that it has been powered on, and a long beep to indicate that it has been powered off. It is important to remember that simply pressing the power button will not turn off the camera, and will instead put it into sleep mode.</p>

<h2>Using Sleep Mode</h2>

<p>When the camera is in sleep mode, it will remain in this state until it is manually turned off or until the battery runs out. If the camera is not used for an extended period of time, it is recommended to turn it off manually. This can be done by pressing and holding the power button for 3 seconds, until the camera emits a long beep. This will ensure that the battery is not drained unnecessarily.</p>

<h2>Using the GoPro App</h2>

<p>The GoPro app can also be used to control the camera remotely. This allows users to turn the camera on and off, adjust the settings, and even start and stop recordings from their smartphone or tablet. This can be particularly useful when the camera is mounted in a difficult to reach location, or when the user does not have direct access to the camera.</p>
