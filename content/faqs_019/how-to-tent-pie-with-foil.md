Tenting a pie with foil is a great way to prevent your pie from burning or over-browning during the baking process. The foil traps in the moisture and prevents the top of the pie from getting too brown. This technique is especially helpful for double-crust pies, as the top crust may need more time to cook than the bottom crust. Here's how to tent pie with foil.

<h2>What You Need</h2>

To tent your pie, you'll need a large piece of aluminum foil. You can purchase pre-cut foil sheets, or you can cut your own. Make sure that the foil is large enough to completely cover the top of your pie.

<h2>Preparing the Pie</h2>

Before you tent your pie with foil, you'll need to prepare it. Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe. If your pie is a double-crust pie, make sure that the top crust is properly crimped and sealed.

<h2>Tenting the Pie</h2>

Once your pie is ready to go, it's time to tent it with foil. Take your large piece of foil and lightly cover the top of the pie. Make sure that the sides of the foil are tucked in, so that the steam from the pie won't escape. You don't want the foil to touch the top of the pie, as this could cause the crust to stick to the foil.

<h2>Baking the Pie</h2>

Place the foil-covered pie in the preheated oven and bake according to the recipe instructions. The foil should remain in place until the pie is finished baking. Once the pie is done, carefully remove the foil and discard it. Your pie should be perfectly cooked and browned!
