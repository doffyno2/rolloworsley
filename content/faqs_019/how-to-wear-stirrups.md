How to Wear Stirrups: An Essential Guide

 
Stirrups are a type of footwear designed for riding horses. They are typically made of metal or leather, and are attached to the saddle of the horse. Riders will place their feet into the stirrups, which helps them to stay balanced and secure when riding. Stirrups can also provide additional support for the rider, as well as offering protection from the horse’s movements.

<h2>The History of Stirrups</h2> 
Stirrups have been used for centuries, with the first known stirrups appearing in China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC–220 AD).
