<p>The acronym "ATTN" stands for "attention" and is commonly used in mailing addresses as a way of specifying who the letter or package is intended for. When used in a mailing address, the term can help ensure that the recipient's name is properly included in the address.</p>

<p>It is important to note that "ATTN" is not the same as "ATTN:" or "ATTN: John Doe." The latter two examples are used to indicate that the mail is intended for a specific individual, while the former is simply used to indicate that the mail is intended for the addressee.</p>

<h2>How to Use ATTN in a Mailing Address</h2>

<p>When using ATTN in a mailing address, it should be placed after the recipient's name and before the street address. For example, if you are sending a letter to John Doe at 123 Main Street, your address should be written as follows:</p>

<p>John Doe<br>
ATTN:<br>
123 Main Street<br>
Anytown, USA</p>

<p>If you are sending a package to a business or organization, the address should include the name of the business or organization followed by ATTN. For example, if you are sending a package to the ABC Corporation at 123 Main Street, your address should be written as follows:</p>

<p>ABC Corporation<br>
ATTN:<br>
123 Main Street<br>
Anytown, USA</p>
