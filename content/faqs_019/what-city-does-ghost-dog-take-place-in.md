<p>Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai is a 1999 American crime drama film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. Starring Forest Whitaker, the film follows the adventures of an African-American loner living in an industrial town in Jersey City, New Jersey. Much of the film was shot in and around Jersey City, and the city serves as the backdrop to the story.</p>

<p>The film follows Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker) as he navigates a life of isolation, loyalty, and violence. He is a contract killer loyal to the Mafia, but lives a solitary life following the ancient Japanese code of the samurai, which he learned from a book he found in a library. Ghost Dog is a loner who lives in an industrial area of Jersey City, New Jersey, where he keeps himself to himself and has few friends other than his pet pigeon.</p>

<p>Ghost Dog is a man who is out of place in the modern world. His samurai code clashes with the traditional Mafia ideals, and he becomes an outcast as a result. As Ghost Dog struggles to maintain his code of honor in an increasingly hostile world, he finds himself embroiled in a conflict between the Mafia and its enemies.</p>

<p>The movie has been shot in various locations in Jersey City, including the industrial area of Greenville, the waterfront area of Exchange Place, and the city's historic downtown. The historic downtown of Jersey City is a vibrant part of the city and is home to a number of landmarks, including the Colgate Clock, the Harsimus Cove and the Jersey City Museum. The Colgate Clock is a landmark and a symbol of Jersey City, and it appears in the movie as the backdrop to some of the action.</p>

<p>The waterfront area of Exchange Place is another iconic location featured in the movie. Exchange Place was the original commercial center of Jersey City and the home of the Exchange Place ferry terminal. This area is now home to many restaurants and bars, as well as the Exchange Place PATH station, which serves commuters traveling to and from New York City.</p>

<p>Greenville, the industrial area of Jersey City, is also featured in the movie. The area is home to a number of factories and warehouses and is a stark contrast to the more vibrant areas of the city. The area is also home to the Greenville Yards, the abandoned train yard that appears in the movie as Ghost Dog's hideout.</p>
