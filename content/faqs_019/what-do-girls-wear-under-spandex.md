<p>Whether you’re training for a marathon or just looking to stay comfortable and stylish while working out, spandex is a great choice for any girl’s activewear wardrobe. But what do you wear under spandex? In this article, we’ll provide some tips for choosing the right garments for maximum comfort and flexibility.</p>

<h2>What Is Spandex?</h2>

<p>Spandex is a synthetic fiber that is known for its elasticity and strength. It is often used in activewear and swimwear because it is lightweight, breathable, and can stretch up to five times its original size. It is also resistant to wrinkles, fading, and shrinking, making it a great material for long-lasting clothing.</p>

<h2>Underwear for Spandex Outfits</h2>

<p>When wearing spandex, the most important thing to consider is the type of underwear you choose. When you’re wearing tight-fitting clothing, you don’t want any visible panty lines or uncomfortable seams. There are several types of underwear that are perfect for spandex wear.</p>

<h3>Thong Panties</h3>

<p>One of the best options for wearing under spandex is a thong panty. This type of underwear is designed to be almost invisible underneath clothing, so there won’t be any lines or bumps showing through. Thongs come in a variety of styles and materials, from soft cotton to sexy lace. They are also available in a range of sizes, so you can find one that fits you perfectly.</p>

<h3>Boy Shorts</h3>

<p>Boy shorts are a great alternative for women who want a bit more coverage. They provide full coverage at the front, but have a low-rise back that sits just below the waistline, so there won’t be any visible panty lines. This type of underwear is also available in a range of materials and styles, so you can find one that’s perfect for your spandex outfit.</p>

<h3>Seamless Panties</h3>

<p>Seamless panties are designed to provide maximum comfort and flexibility. They are made from a single piece of fabric, so there are no visible seams or panty lines. These panties are perfect for wearing under spandex because they provide a smooth and comfortable fit.</p>

<h2>Sports Bras for Spandex Outfits</h2>

<p>When wearing spandex, it’s important to choose the right sports bra to provide the support you need. Sports bras are designed to keep your breasts in place during intense physical activities, such as running or jumping. They come in a variety of styles and materials, from supportive racerback bras to lightweight sports bras.</p>

<h3>Compression Sports Bras</h3>

<p>Compression sports bras are designed to provide maximum support and reduce movement. They are made from a tight-fitting material that hugs your body, providing a snug and secure fit. These bras are perfect for activities that involve high-impact movements, such as running or jumping.</p>

<h3>Encapsulation Sports Bras</h3>

<p>Encapsulation sports bras are designed to provide support and shape. They are made from two separate pieces of fabric that fit around each breast, providing a secure and comfortable fit. These bras are perfect for activities that involve less impact, such as yoga or cycling.</p>

<h2>Accessories for Spandex Outfits</h2>

<p>In addition to underwear and sports bras, there are several other accessories that are perfect for wearing with spandex. Many women choose to wear a headband or a hat to keep their hair out of their face while exercising. Other popular accessories include sunglasses, water bottles, and wristbands. These items can help keep you comfortable and stylish while you work out.</p>
