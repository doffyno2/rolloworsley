If you've ever had the misfortune of screwing something threaded in the wrong direction or with a wrong size, you know how important it is to have the right tools and techniques to unscrew it. This guide will help you understand how to unscrew something threaded wrong so you can get the job done quickly and correctly.</p>

<h2>Why Does Threaded Fastening Go Wrong?</h2>

<p>Threaded fastening is a simple process of connecting two components by twisting one component into another. If a threaded fastening goes wrong, it's usually because of one of two reasons. The first is that the threaded fastener is too large for the hole it's being screwed into. The second is that the threaded fastener has been screwed in the wrong direction, resulting in a jammed or stuck fastener.</p>

<h2>What Tools Do I Need?</h2>

<p>The tools you need for unscrewing something threaded wrong depend on the type of fastener and the severity of the problem. If the fastener is simply stuck, you may be able to use a pair of pliers or a wrench to unscrew it. If the fastener is severely jammed, you may need to use a drill or other power tool to get it out.</p>

<h2>How Can I Prevent Threaded Fastening From Going Wrong?</h2>
