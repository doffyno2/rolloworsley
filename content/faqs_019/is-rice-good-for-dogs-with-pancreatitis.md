Pancreatitis is a serious condition in dogs that can be extremely uncomfortable and even fatal. It occurs when the pancreas becomes inflamed, which can be caused by a variety of factors. The most common symptom of pancreatitis is abdominal pain, but other signs such as vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration can also occur. Treatment for pancreatitis varies depending on the severity of the condition, but can include dietary changes, antibiotics, and medications. 

One of the most common dietary changes recommended for dogs with pancreatitis is to reduce the amount of fat in their diet.
