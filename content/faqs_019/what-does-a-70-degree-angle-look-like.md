<p>A 70 degree angle is an acute angle, meaning it is less than 90 degrees. It is also known as an obtuse angle, which is an angle between 90 and 180 degrees. A 70 degree angle looks like a sharp V shape. It is often used in mathematical calculations, such as finding the area of a triangle, or calculating the angle between two lines.</p>

<h2>What Does a 70 Degree Angle Look Like in Real Life?</h2>

<p>A 70 degree angle can be seen in the natural world. It is seen in the corners of a square, the angles of a pentagon, the edges of a hexagon and the corners of an octagon. It is also seen in the angles of a right triangle, which make up 90 degrees when combined. In addition, a 70 degree angle can be seen in many everyday objects, such as the edges of a book, the sides of a chair, or the points of a compass.</p>

<h2>How to Draw a 70 Degree Angle</h2>

<p>Drawing a 70 degree angle is quite easy. Start by drawing a straight line. Then, divide the line into two equal parts by drawing a perpendicular line through its center. This will create two 45 degree angles. Now draw a line from one end of the line to the point at which the perpendicular line intersects the original line. This line should form a 70 degree angle with the original line.</p>

<h2>How to Measure a 70 Degree Angle</h2>

<p>Measuring a 70 degree angle requires the use of a protractor. First, line up the vertex of the angle with the center of the protractor. Then, make sure the base line of the protractor is aligned with one side of the angle. Finally, read the measurement where the other side of the angle intersects the protractor. If the measurement is between 68 and 72 degrees, then it is a 70 degree angle.</p>

<h2>What is the Complement of a 70 Degree Angle?</h2>

<p>The complement of a 70 degree angle is the angle that, when added to the 70 degree angle, produces a 90 degree angle. The complement of a 70 degree angle is 20 degrees, since 70 + 20 = 90. This can be seen by drawing a 90 degree angle, and then subtracting 70 degrees from it.</p>

<h2>What is the Supplement of a 70 Degree Angle?</h2>

<p>The supplement of a 70 degree angle is the angle that, when added to the 70 degree angle, produces a 180 degree angle. The supplement of a 70 degree angle is 110 degrees, since 70 + 110 = 180. This can be seen by drawing a 180 degree angle, and then subtracting 70 degrees from it.</p>

<h2>What is the Exterior Angle of a 70 Degree Angle?</h2>

<p>The exterior angle of a 70 degree angle is the angle that is formed by extending one side of the angle. The exterior angle of a 70 degree angle is 110 degrees, since 70 + 110 = 180. This can be seen by drawing a 180 degree angle, and then subtracting 70 degrees from it.</p>

<h2>What is the Interior Angle of a 70 Degree Angle?</h2>

<p>The interior angle of a 70 degree angle is the angle formed by the two sides of the angle. The interior angle of a 70 degree angle is 140 degrees, since 70 + 140 = 210. This can be seen by drawing a 210 degree angle, and then subtracting 70 degrees from it.</p>
