What Does The Camel's Nose Under The Tent Mean?

The phrase “the camel's nose under the tent” is an idiom used to refer to a seemingly small and insignificant action that can have far-reaching and potentially negative effects. It is often used to describe the gradual and insidious process of something being allowed or accepted, even when it is against the interests of those involved.

The phrase is derived from the idea that if a camel sticks its nose under a tent and is allowed to stay, it will eventually fill the entire tent. The phrase can be used to describe any situation where allowing something seemingly small can have large, negative consequences.

The phrase is also used to illustrate how policy changes can have unintended and far-reaching consequences. In particular, it is often used to describe the unintended consequences of well-intentioned policies, such as those designed to promote economic growth.
