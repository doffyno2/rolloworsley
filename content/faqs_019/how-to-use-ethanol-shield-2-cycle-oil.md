<p>Ethanol Shield 2 Cycle Oil is a specially formulated oil designed to protect two-stroke engines from the damaging effects of ethanol blended fuels. This oil is designed to protect against corrosion, wear, and carbon deposits that can occur when running an engine on ethanol blended fuels. In addition to protecting your engine, it also helps to maximize engine performance and fuel efficiency. Here's how to use Ethanol Shield 2 Cycle Oil for maximum protection and improved performance.</p>

<h2>Understand Ethanol Blended Fuels </h2>

<p>Ethanol blended fuels are a combination of gasoline and ethanol, usually in the ratio of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline. Ethanol blended fuel can cause damage to two-stroke engines if they are not used with the correct oil. It is important to understand the potential damage that can occur when using ethanol blended fuels.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Oil </h2>

<p>Ethanol Shield 2 Cycle Oil is a special oil designed specifically for use in two-stroke engines that run on ethanol blended fuels. It is formulated to protect against corrosion, wear, and carbon deposits. It also helps to maximize engine performance and fuel efficiency. It is important to use the correct oil when running your engine on ethanol blended fuels.</p>

<h2>Understand the Oil to Fuel Ratio </h2>

<p>The oil to fuel ratio for two-stroke engines running on ethanol blended fuels is different than for engines running on gasoline only. It is important to understand the correct ratio for your engine so that you can add the right amount of oil. The oil to fuel ratio for Ethanol Shield 2 Cycle Oil is 40 parts fuel to 1 part oil.</p>

<h2>Mix the Oil and Fuel </h2>

<p>Once you have determined the correct oil to fuel ratio for your engine, it is time to mix the oil and fuel together. To do this, add the oil to a separate container and then slowly add the fuel while stirring or shaking the mixture. Once the oil and fuel are completely mixed, it is ready to be added to the fuel tank.</p>

<h2>Add the Mixture to the Fuel Tank </h2>

<p>Once the oil and fuel mixture is ready, it can be added to the fuel tank. Make sure that the fuel tank is empty before adding the mixture. Once the mixture is added to the tank, it is ready for use in your two-stroke engine.</p>

<h2>Run the Engine </h2>

<p>Once the fuel tank is filled with the oil and fuel mixture, it is time to start the engine. Make sure that the engine is running properly and that there are no leaks. If all is well, the engine can now be used with the Ethanol Shield 2 Cycle Oil.</p>
