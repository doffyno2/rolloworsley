A wall cloud is a type of storm cloud that can form during a thunderstorm. It is a large, rotating cloud formation that is usually found beneath the base of a cumulonimbus cloud. Wall clouds can range in size from a few hundred feet to several miles in diameter, and they are usually associated with strong winds, heavy rains, and hail.

<h2>What Causes a Wall Cloud?</h2>

Wall clouds form when warm, moist air rises rapidly and encounters the cooler air at the base of the cumulonimbus cloud. This causes the warm air to rotate, creating an updraft which can become very strong. As the updraft strengthens, it causes the air to rotate faster and form a wall-like structure which is visible from the ground.

<h2>What Does a Wall Cloud Look Like?</h2>

Wall clouds are typically dark gray or black in color and can range in size from a few hundred feet to several miles in diameter. They often appear to be rotating, and they may have a “shelf-like” appearance with a flat base. Wall clouds may also have a “tail” that extends away from the thunderstorm.

<h2>What Are the Different Types of Wall Clouds?</h2>

There are several types of wall clouds, including:

<h3>Shelf Clouds</h3>

Shelf clouds are wall clouds that have a shelf-like appearance with a flat base and an extending tail. They are usually associated with strong winds and heavy rains.

<h3>Lenticular Clouds</h3>

Lenticular clouds are wall clouds that are shaped like a lens or an airplane wing. They are often associated with strong winds, heavy rains, and hail.

<h3>Rotating Wall Clouds</h3>

Rotating wall clouds are wall clouds that are rotating, usually counter-clockwise. They are usually associated with strong winds, heavy rains, and hail.

<h2>What Are the Signs of an Approaching Wall Cloud?</h2>

There are several signs that indicate an approaching wall cloud, including:

<h3>Darkening Sky</h3>

The sky may begin to darken as the wall cloud approaches. This is due to the sun being blocked by the cloud.

<h3>Strong Winds</h3>

Strong winds may begin to blow as the wall cloud approaches. These winds can be dangerous, so it is important to seek shelter if they become too strong.

<h3>Heavy Rain and Hail</h3>

Heavy rain and hail may accompany a wall cloud. These can also be dangerous, so it is important to seek shelter if they become too strong.

<h2>What Should You Do When a Wall Cloud Approaches?</h2>

It is important to seek shelter when a wall cloud approaches. Wall clouds can cause strong winds, heavy rain, and hail, which can be dangerous. If you are outdoors, try to find a safe place such as a sturdy building or car. If you are indoors, stay inside and away from windows.
