<p>When it comes to English grammar, it can be hard to know what is considered correct and what isn't. It's no different when it comes to talking about transportation. Many people are confused about whether they should say "I am driving a bike" or "I am riding a bike". So, which one is grammatically correct? </p>

<h2>What is the Difference Between Driving and Riding? </h2>

<p>The primary difference between driving and riding is that driving usually involves controlling a vehicle, while riding usually doesn’t. When you drive a car or truck, you’re in control of the vehicle. You have to use the steering wheel, the brakes, and the gas pedal to move the car. When you ride a bike, you don’t need to actively control the bike. You just have to sit on it and pedal. </p>

<p>The other difference is that when you’re driving, you’re usually going a faster speed than when you’re riding. For example, when you’re driving a car, you’re usually going much faster than when you’re riding a bike. </p>

<h2>So, What Should I Say? </h2>

<p>When it comes to talking about transportation, the correct phrase to use is “I am riding a bike”. This is because when you’re on a bike, you’re not actively controlling the bike. You’re just sitting on it and pedaling. If you were controlling the bike, then you would say “I am driving a bike”. However, this is rarely the case. </p>

<p>So, when you’re talking about transportation, it’s always best to use the phrase “I am riding a bike”. This is the most accurate phrase to use and it’s also grammatically correct. </p>
