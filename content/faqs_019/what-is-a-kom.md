Kom is a type of cycling race that has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is a relatively new form of organized cycling competition that combines the physical challenge of a road race with the technical aspects of mountain biking. The Kom race format is intended to be accessible to all levels of cyclists, from beginner to pro. 

<h2>History of KOMs</h2>

KOM stands for “King of the Mountain,” and the concept originated in the 1920s in the French Alps. The first “king of the mountain” race was held in 1924 on the slopes of the Col du Tourmalet to honor the winner of the Tour de France mountain stage. The race was eventually adopted by the UCI (Union Cycliste Internationale) as an official type of competition in the 1990s. 

<h2>What are KOMs?</h2>

KOMs, or King of the Mountain races, are a type of cycling race that combines the physical challenge of a road race with the technical aspects of mountain biking. In a KOM event, cyclists race against each other on a set course that includes both uphill and downhill sections. The goal is to be the first to reach the top of the mountain, or the highest point on the course. The winner of the race is crowned the "King of the Mountain." 

<h2>Types of KOMs</h2>

KOMs come in two main formats: mass-start and time-trial. Mass-start KOMs involve all the cyclists starting at the same time and racing against each other to the finish line. Time-trial KOMs, on the other hand, involve each cyclist starting at a different time and racing against the clock. 

<h2>KOM Races</h2>

KOM races are typically organized as either one-day events or as a series of stages over multiple days. The courses used for KOM races can vary greatly, from short, steep climbs to longer, more gradual ascents. Some courses even involve technical sections that require riders to negotiate rocky sections and tight switchbacks. 

<h2>KOM Scoring</h2>

KOMs are scored using the same system as road and mountain bike races. Points are awarded to the top finishers in each stage of the race and the overall winner is determined by the cyclist who has accumulated the most points. Points are also awarded for intermediate sprints, mountain passes, and time bonuses. 

<h2>KOM Gear</h2>

KOMs require specialized gear in order to ensure a competitive performance. Cyclists typically use lightweight road bikes with narrow tires and a low gear ratio to make climbing easier. Mountain bikes can also be used in KOM events, although they are usually slower on the climbs. In addition, most cyclists opt for lightweight cycling apparel, such as bib shorts and lightweight jerseys, to reduce drag.
