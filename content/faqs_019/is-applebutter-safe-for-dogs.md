<p>Apple butter is a type of spread or jam made from apples. It's a popular condiment that is often used to enhance the flavor of a variety of meals. But is apple butter safe for dogs?</p>

If your dog is prone to weight gain, or has a health condition that requires a low-fat diet, then it's best to avoid feeding him apple butter.
