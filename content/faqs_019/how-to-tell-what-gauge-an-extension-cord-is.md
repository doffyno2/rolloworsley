Extension cords are a great way to extend the reach of your electrical power, but if you don’t know what gauge an extension cord is, it can be difficult to determine how much power you can safely draw from it. The gauge of an extension cord is determined by its wire size, which is measured in American Wire Gauge (AWG). Knowing the gauge of an extension cord is important because it will tell you the maximum amount of power you can draw from it safely.

<h2>What Is the American Wire Gauge (AWG)?</h2>

The American Wire Gauge (AWG) is a standardized system for measuring the diameter of electrical wires. The lower the AWG number, the thicker the wire and the greater the amount of current it can safely carry. The most common AWG sizes for extension cords are 14, 12 and 10. 

<h2>What Is the Difference Between Gauge and Amps?</h2>

Gauge and amps are two different ways of measuring the same thing: the amount of electrical current an extension cord can safely carry. Gauge is a measurement of the wire size, while amps is a measurement of the amount of current an extension cord can safely handle. You can calculate the maximum amps an extension cord can handle based on the AWG of the wire:

<h3>14 Gauge: 15 Amps</h3>
<h3>12 Gauge: 20 Amps</h3>
<h3>10 Gauge: 30 Amps</h3>

<h2>How to Tell What Gauge an Extension Cord Is?</h2>

It can be difficult to tell what gauge an extension cord is just by looking at it, but there are a few ways to figure it out. The easiest way is to look at the label on the cord. Most extension cords will have a label indicating the AWG size. If the label is missing or illegible, you can also measure the diameter of the wire with a caliper.

<h3>14 Gauge: 0.064”</h3>
<h3>12 Gauge: 0.081”</h3>
<h3>10 Gauge: 0.103”</h3>

If you don’t have access to a caliper, you can also look for the AWG size on the plug. Most plugs will have the AWG size printed on them.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Using a Higher Gauge Extension Cord?</h2>

Using a higher gauge extension cord can have several benefits. The thicker the wire, the more current it can safely carry. This means that higher gauge extension cords are able to handle more power and are less likely to overheat. Higher gauge extension cords are also more durable and less likely to be damaged by rough handling.

<h2>What Are the Downsides of Using a Higher Gauge Extension Cord?</h2>

The biggest downside of using a higher gauge extension cord is that it is usually more expensive than lower gauge extension cords. Higher gauge extension cords also tend to be bulkier and more difficult to store.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Knowing how to tell what gauge an extension cord is can help you choose the right extension cord for your needs. If you’re looking for an extension cord that can handle a lot of power without overheating, a higher gauge extension cord is the way to go. However, if you’re looking for a more affordable option, a lower gauge extension cord may be the better choice.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is the American Wire Gauge (AWG)?</h3>
The American Wire Gauge (AWG) is a standardized system for measuring the diameter of electrical wires. The lower the AWG number, the thicker the wire and the greater the amount of current it can safely carry.

<h3>What is the difference between gauge and amps?</h3>
Gauge is a measurement of the wire size, while amps is a measurement of the amount of current an extension cord can safely handle. You can calculate the maximum amps an extension cord can handle based on the AWG of the wire.

<h3>How can I tell what gauge an extension cord is?</h3>
You can tell what gauge an extension cord is by looking at the label on the cord, measuring the diameter of the wire with a caliper, or looking for the AWG size on the plug.

<h3>What are the benefits of using a higher gauge extension cord?</h3>
Using a higher gauge extension cord can have several benefits. The thicker the wire, the more current it can safely carry. This means that higher gauge extension cords are able to handle more power and are less likely to overheat. Higher gauge extension cords are also more durable and less likely to be damaged by rough handling.

<h3>What are the downsides of using a higher gauge extension cord?</h3>
The biggest downside of using a higher gauge extension cord is that it is usually more expensive than lower gauge extension cords. Higher gauge extension cords also tend to be bulkier and more difficult to store.

<h3>How do I calculate the maximum amps an extension cord can handle?</h3>
You can calculate the maximum amps an extension cord can handle based on the AWG of the wire. For example, a 14 gauge extension cord can handle up to 15 Amps, a 12 gauge extension cord can handle up to 20 Amps, and a 10 gauge extension cord can handle up to 30 Amps. 

<h3>What is the most common AWG size for extension cords?</h3>
The most common AWG sizes for extension cords are 14, 12 and 10.
