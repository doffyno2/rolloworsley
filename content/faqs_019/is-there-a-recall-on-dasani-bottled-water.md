<p>Dasani bottled water is a popular brand of purified water that is sold in many grocery stores and convenience stores. It is produced by The Coca-Cola Company and its purpose is to provide consumers with a convenient and affordable way to stay hydrated. Many people choose Dasani bottled water due to its taste, convenience, and affordability. However, there have been some concerns raised recently about the safety of Dasani water.</p> 

<p>In February 2018, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) released a report that found traces of arsenic in some samples of Dasani bottled water. The amount of arsenic found was very small, but it was still enough to raise alarm bells. The EWG also noted that Dasani had failed to disclose their water source, which they said was concerning. In response to the report, Dasani issued a statement saying that the levels of arsenic found in their water did not pose a health risk.</p>

<h2>What Is the Health Risk of Drinking Arsenic-Contaminated Water?</h2>

<p>Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that can be found in drinking water. Long-term exposure to high levels of arsenic can lead to health issues such as skin, bladder, and lung cancer. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the maximum amount of arsenic in drinking water should not exceed 10 micrograms per liter. In the case of Dasani, the levels of arsenic found in their water were only 0.2 micrograms per liter, which is well below the WHO’s recommended safe limit.</p>

<p>However, the EWG warns that even low levels of arsenic can be dangerous over the long-term. They recommend that consumers should limit their exposure to arsenic as much as possible. They also suggest that people should switch to bottled water brands that are sourced from municipal water systems, which are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>

<h2>What Is the Current Status of the Recall?</h2>

<p>At the time of writing, there is no recall on Dasani bottled water. The Coca-Cola Company has denied all allegations of contamination and insists that their water is safe to drink. However, they have agreed to conduct further testing to ensure that their water meets all safety standards. The results of this testing have not yet been released.</p>

<p>In the meantime, consumers can take steps to limit their exposure to arsenic. The EWG recommends that people switch to bottled water brands that are sourced from municipal water systems, which are regulated by the EPA. They also suggest that people should install a home water filter to remove any traces of arsenic from their tap water.</p>
