<p>When looking for the perfect pair of sunglasses, one of the first features to consider is size. But what do the size letters E and W mean when it comes to sunglasses?</p>

<p>The size of sunglasses is measured by the width of the lens and the bridge in millimeters. The size of the lens is measured from the inside of the lens from one temple to the other. The bridge of the sunglasses is the piece of material that connects the two lenses, and the size is measured from the inside of one lens to the other. The size letters E and W refer to the width of the lens and bridge of the sunglasses.</p>

<h2>What Does Size E Mean in Sunglasses?</h2>

<p>Size E, or extra wide, sunglasses are usually labeled as 63-14-120. This means that the lens width is 63 millimeters, the bridge width is 14 millimeters, and the length of the temple is 120 millimeters. For sunglasses with a size E, both the lens and bridge are wider than average. These sunglasses are best suited for those with larger faces or wider cheekbones.</p>

<h2>What Does Size W Mean in Sunglasses?</h2>

<p>Size W, or wide, sunglasses are usually labeled as 58-14-125. This means that the lens width is 58 millimeters, the bridge width is 14 millimeters, and the length of the temple is 125 millimeters. For sunglasses with a size W, the lens width is wider than average, but the bridge width is the same as average. These sunglasses are best suited for those with larger faces or wider cheekbones.</p>

The best way to find the right size for you is to try on several pairs until you find one that fits comfortably. You should also keep in mind that the size of the sunglasses will depend on the shape of your face. For example, if you have a round face, then a size E will be too wide, while a size W will be too narrow.
