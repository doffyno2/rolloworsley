<p>The number 36 is a composite number, meaning it is composed of smaller numbers that can be multiplied to make 36. It is an even number and can be divided evenly by two numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 36. Knowing what the factors of 36 are can be helpful in a variety of situations.</p>

<h2>Finding the Factors of 36</h2>

<p>To find the factors of 36, a person can use the greatest common factor (GCF) method. The GCF method involves taking two or more numbers and dividing them until there is no remainder. To find the factors of 36, start by taking the two largest factors, 18 and 36. Divide each number by the other until there is no remainder. In this case, 18 divided by 36 is equal to 0 with a remainder of 18. This indicates that 18 is a factor of 36.</p>

<p>Next, take the two smallest factors, 1 and 36. Divide each number by the other until there is no remainder. In this case, 1 divided by 36 is equal to 0 with a remainder of 1. This indicates that 1 is a factor of 36.</p>

<p>The factors of 36 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 36.</p>

<h2>Uses for Factors of 36</h2>

<p>Knowing what the factors of 36 are can be helpful for a variety of tasks. For example, if a person needs to divide 36 by a certain number, they can use the factors of 36 to find the answer. For instance, if a person needs to divide 36 by 4, they can use the GCF method of dividing 36 by 4 to get the answer. In this case, the answer is 9.</p>

<p>The factors of 36 can also be used to solve other mathematical problems. For instance, if a person needs to find the square root of 36, they can use the factors of 36 to find the answer. In this case, the square root of 36 is 6.</p>

<p>The factors of 36 can also be used to find the lowest common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers. For example, if a person wants to find the LCM of 8 and 36, they can use the factors of 36 to find the answer. In this case, the LCM is 72.</p>
