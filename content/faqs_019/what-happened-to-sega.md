The gaming industry has seen many companies rise and fall over the years, and Sega is no exception. Founded in 1960 in Japan, Sega was a major force in the video game industry during the 1980s and 1990s. It was a leader in arcade game production and console game production, and its games were played around the world. But what happened to Sega?

<h2>Sega's Early Years</h2>

Sega was founded in 1960 by Martin Bromley and was initially named "Standard Games". The company started out as a manufacturer and distributor of coin-operated amusement machines, and its first game was "Periscope", a submarine simulator released in 1966. As the company grew, it changed its name to "Sega Enterprises" in 1965, and it released its first home console, the SG-1000, in 1983. 

Sega achieved great success in the arcades during the 1980s, and it released its most successful console to date, the Sega Genesis, in 1988. The Genesis was a 16-bit console which was more powerful than its 8-bit competitors, and its library of games included some of the most popular titles of all time, such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Streets of Rage, and Phantasy Star.

<h2>The Sega Saturn Era</h2>

In 1994, Sega released its next console, the Sega Saturn. The Saturn was the first console to use CD-ROMs, and it was also the first console to use a 32-bit processor. It was well-received by critics, but it failed to gain enough market share to compete with its main rival, the Sony PlayStation. Despite its technical capabilities, the Saturn's library of games was limited, and it was eventually discontinued in 1998.

<h2>Dreamcast and Beyond</h2>

Sega's final console was the Dreamcast, released in 1999. The Dreamcast was the first console to feature online play and built-in modem support, and it was also the first console to use a 128-bit processor. While it was well-received by critics, the Dreamcast failed to gain enough market share to compete with the PlayStation 2 and other consoles. 

In 2001, Sega announced that it was leaving the console market and would focus on software development instead. Since then, Sega has released a number of popular titles, including Sonic Adventure, Shenmue, and Yakuza.

<h2>What Happened to Sega?</h2>

Since leaving the console market, Sega has continued to be a major player in the gaming industry. While they no longer make hardware, they are still a major publisher, and they continue to develop popular titles for all major platforms. Sega is also a major mobile game developer, and their games are available on Android and iOS.
