<p>Herkimer Diamonds are incredibly beautiful and desirable gemstones, which have been treasured for centuries. The stone is actually a double-terminated quartz crystal, and is found in Herkimer County, New York. It is highly sought after by jewelers and collectors, but it can be hard to tell if a Herkimer diamond is real or not. Fortunately, there are a few simple tests you can perform to determine if your Herkimer Diamond is genuine.</p>

<h2>What Does a Herkimer Diamond Look Like?</h2>

<p>A genuine Herkimer diamond is a quartz crystal with a unique double-terminated shape. It has 18 facets, and is usually clear or translucent in color. It can range in size from 1mm to 15mm, and can be found in a variety of colors ranging from white to yellow, green, blue, and even black. The stones can also have a variety of inclusions such as iron, mica, and other minerals. Herkimer diamonds are usually found embedded in dolomite or calcite.</p>

<h2>The Scratch Test</h2>

<p>One of the easiest ways to determine if a Herkimer diamond is real or not is to perform a scratch test. Genuine Herkimer diamonds have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, which means they can be scratched by quartz (6.5 on the Mohs scale) or a steel file (7.5 on the Mohs scale). Take a quartz or steel file, and gently scratch the surface of the gemstone. If the stone is scratched, it is likely a fake. If it is not scratched, it is likely a genuine Herkimer diamond.</p>

<h2>The Magnification Test</h2>

<p>Another way to tell if a Herkimer diamond is real is to use a magnifying glass or microscope to examine the stone. Genuine Herkimer diamonds have a unique double-terminated shape and 18 facets, so use the magnifying glass or microscope to look for these features. If the stone does not have the correct shape or does not have 18 facets, it is likely not a genuine Herkimer diamond.</p>

<h2>The Fluorescence Test</h2>

<p>A third way to tell if a Herkimer diamond is real is to perform a fluorescence test. Genuine Herkimer diamonds are fluorescent under ultraviolet light, meaning they will glow in the dark. Shine an ultraviolet light on the stone, and if it glows, it is likely a genuine Herkimer diamond. If it does not glow, it is likely not a genuine Herkimer diamond.</p>

<h2>The Hardness Test</h2>

<p>A fourth way to tell if a Herkimer diamond is real is to perform a hardness test. Genuine Herkimer diamonds have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale, so use a hardness testing device to measure the hardness of the stone. If the stone is softer than 7 on the Mohs scale, it is likely not a genuine Herkimer diamond.</p>
