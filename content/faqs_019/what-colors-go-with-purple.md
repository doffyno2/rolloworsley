Purple is a vibrant and versatile color, and there are many shades of purple you can use in your decorating projects. Whether you’re looking to add a bit of luxury to your home or want to create a unique color palette, it’s important to know what colors go with purple.

<h2>Complementary Colors</h2>

When it comes to decorating with purple, it’s important to pick complementary colors to make the room look cohesive. The two colors that are opposite of purple on the color wheel are yellow and green. This means that yellow and green are complementary to purple, and this can be a great way to create an eye-catching color palette. To make the most of this color combination, use shades of yellow and green that are similar in tone to the purple hue you’ve chosen. You can also use a lighter shade of yellow or green for a subtle effect.

<h2>Analogous Colors</h2>

Another way to create a cohesive color palette is to use analogous colors. These are colors that are next to each other on the color wheel and have similar tones. In the case of purple, the analogous colors are blue and red. To create a harmonious effect, use shades of blue and red that are similar in tone to the purple hue you’ve chosen. This will give the room a unified look that is perfect for a modern or contemporary style.

<h2>Accent Colors</h2>

If you want to add an extra punch to your color palette, you can use an accent color. This is a color that is used sparingly to give the room a pop of color. For purple, you can use a bright orange or pink to make the room look fresh and vibrant. You can also use a neutral color like white or gray to give the room a clean, modern look.

<h2>Matching Colors</h2>

When it comes to matching colors, the key is to use shades that are similar in tone. If you’re working with a purple hue, you can use other purples to create a monochromatic look. To keep the look interesting, try using different shades of purple and adding touches of white or black to break up the monochromatic look.

<h2>Light and Dark Shades</h2>

One of the best ways to create an interesting color palette is to use light and dark shades of the same color. For example, you can use a light purple paired with a deep, dark purple for a dramatic look. This will give the room a sense of depth and dimension that is perfect for a modern or contemporary space.

<h2>Contrasting Colors</h2>

If you want to create a bold and eye-catching look, you can use contrasting colors. These are colors that are opposite of each other on the color wheel and have different tones. For purple, the contrasting colors are blue and orange. To create a bold look, try using a deep, dark purple with a bright orange or pink. This is a great way to make a statement in any room.
