A bull ride is scored on a scale of 0-100 points, with 100 points being the highest score. The judges score a ride on the bull's performance, the rider's performance, and the difficulty of the ride. A bull is given a score of 0-25 points based on the difficulty of the ride. The rider is then given a score of 0-75 points based on their performance.
