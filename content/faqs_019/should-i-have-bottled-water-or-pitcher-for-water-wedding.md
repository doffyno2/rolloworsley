<p>When planning a wedding, there are a lot of decisions to make. One of the decisions you need to make is whether to provide bottled water or a pitcher of water for guests. While both are good options, there are pros and cons for each that can help you decide which is best for your wedding.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of Bottled Water</h2>

<p>One of the pros of providing bottled water for guests is that it's convenient. Guests don't have to worry about getting up to refill their glasses, they can just grab a new bottle of water. Additionally, bottled water is also a great option if you're looking for a way to add a little something special to your wedding. You can choose customized bottles with your name and wedding date on them, or you can choose bottles with special designs that reflect the theme of your wedding.</p>

<p>On the other hand, bottled water can be more expensive than a pitcher of water because you have to buy the bottles and the water separately. Additionally, it can be more difficult to clean up after the wedding if you have a lot of empty bottles to throw away.</p>

<h2>Pros and Cons of a Pitcher of Water</h2>

<p>One of the pros of providing a pitcher of water for guests is that it's cheaper than bottled water. You don't have to buy the water or the bottles separately, and it's much easier to clean up after the wedding. Additionally, it's a great way to show guests that you care about the environment by using less plastic.</p>

<p>However, one of the cons of providing a pitcher of water is that it's not as convenient as bottled water. Guests have to get up to refill their glasses, which can be inconvenient if they're not close to the pitcher. Additionally, if you're looking for something special, a pitcher of water won't have the same impact as customized bottles.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When it comes to deciding between bottled water or a pitcher of water for guests at your wedding, there are pros and cons for each option. Bottled water is more convenient and can be customized, but it can be more expensive and difficult to clean up afterwards.
