<p>Ask Jeeves was once one of the most popular search engines on the internet. It was the go-to place for many people looking for answers to questions they had. However, the search engine is no longer around. So, what happened to Ask Jeeves?</p>

<h2>The History of Ask Jeeves</h2>

<p>Ask Jeeves was created in 1996 by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen. It was a question-and-answer search engine that allowed users to type in a question and receive an answer. It was the first search engine to use natural language processing to answer questions. It was able to understand the intent of the question and provide a specific answer. This was revolutionary for its time, and it quickly gained popularity.</p>

<p>At its peak, Ask Jeeves was the third most-used search engine after Google and Yahoo! It was used by millions of people around the world who were looking for answers to their questions. It was even featured in the popular TV show “Friends” in 1999. It seemed as if Ask Jeeves was here to stay.</p>

<h2>The Decline of Ask Jeeves</h2>

<p>However, Ask Jeeves began to decline in popularity in the early 2000s. This was due to several reasons. First, Google began to dominate the search engine market. With its powerful algorithms, Google was able to provide more accurate and relevant results than Ask Jeeves. Additionally, Google's PageRank system gave it an advantage over Ask Jeeves. Finally, Ask Jeeves was unable to keep up with the changing landscape of the internet. As more and more websites began to focus on SEO, Ask Jeeves was left behind.</p>

<p>In 2005, Ask Jeeves was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp and rebranded as “Ask.com”. The goal was to turn Ask.com into a more general web search engine, but it failed to make a dent in Google's market share. In 2010, Ask.com stopped using its own search technology and switched to using Google's search results. This signaled the end of Ask Jeeves.</p>

<h2>What Happened To Ask Jeeves?</h2>
