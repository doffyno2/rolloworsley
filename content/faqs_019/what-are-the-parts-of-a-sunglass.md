Sunglasses are an essential part of fashion and essential to protect our eyes from UV rays. Knowing the parts of a sunglass can help you make a smart purchase and understand how the sunglass works. In this article, we'll discuss the parts of a sunglass, how they work, and why they're important.

<h2>Frame</h2>

The frame of a sunglass is the most important part of the sunglass. It holds the lenses in place and provides protection for the lenses from being scratched or cracked. The frame can be made from a variety of materials including metal, plastic, or even wood. The frame should be lightweight and comfortable to wear.

<h2>Lenses</h2>

The lenses of a sunglass are what filter out the harmful UV rays from the sun. Lenses come in a variety of materials, such as polycarbonate, glass, and even polarized lenses. Polarized lenses are especially important as they block out more of the harmful UV rays. Additionally, some lenses offer additional features such as anti-glare and anti-fog.

<h2>Nosepads</h2>

Nosepads are small pieces of rubber or plastic that are found on the sides of the frame and rest on the bridge of the nose. They provide extra comfort and help keep the glasses in place.

<h2>Temples</h2>

Temples are the arms of the sunglasses that go over the ears. They are typically made of plastic or metal and are adjustable to fit the size of your head.

<h2>Hinges</h2>

Hinges are what allow the temples to fold in and out. They are typically made of metal and are adjustable to fit the size of your head.

<h2>Lens Coatings</h2>

Lens coatings are an extra layer of protection that can be added to the lenses. These coatings are typically made of polycarbonate and help protect the lenses from scratches and other damage. Additionally, they can help reduce glare and offer additional protection from UV rays.

<h2>UV Protection</h2>

UV protection is an important feature of sunglasses. Sunglasses should be made with lenses that offer at least 99% UV protection. This is especially important for people who spend a lot of time outdoors.

<h2>Style</h2>

The style of a sunglass is a personal preference. There are a variety of styles, such as aviator, wayfarer, and wrap-around, to name a few.
