<p>Dogs are known as man’s best friend and are an integral part of many households. As such, pet owners want to make sure their four-legged companions are getting the best nutrition and care possible. One food that has been gaining in popularity is kettle corn. But is it safe for dogs?</p>

<p>Kettle corn is a type of popcorn that is made with a combination of oil and sugar. It is often served at carnivals and other special events, and it has become a popular snack food in recent years.
