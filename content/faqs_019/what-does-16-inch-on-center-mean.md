When it comes to the construction of a building, one of the most important aspects is the framing. It is the frame of a building that provides the structure, supports the weight of the roof, and holds the walls in place. One of the most important aspects of framing is spacing, and the most common spacing is 16 inches on center (16" OC). 

<h2>What Is 16 Inch On Center?</h2>

16 inch on center (16" OC) is a term used to describe the distance between framing components such as studs, joists, and rafters. This distance is measured from the center of one element to the center of the next one. In other words, when a builder or a contractor says that something is 16 inches on center, they mean that the distance between the center of one element and the center of the next one is 16 inches. 

<h2>Why Is 16 Inch On Center Used?</h2>

Additionally, 16" OC can be difficult to work with, as it requires precise measuring and cutting. 

<h2>What Are Alternatives To 16 Inch On Center?</h2>
