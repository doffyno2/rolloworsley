<p>A hairpin corner is a type of cornering maneuver in which the vehicle must sharply turn in the opposite direction of its current direction of travel. The corner typically resembles the shape of a hairpin, hence the name. It is often used in motorsports, such as in Formula One, IndyCar, and Super GT, and is also used in everyday driving situations.
