<p>When a man loses his wife, it can be one of the most devastating events of his life. Depending on the circumstances, he may be grieving the death of his wife due to illness or injury, or he may be dealing with the loss of her due to divorce or other separation. No matter the cause, the pain of losing a spouse is often overwhelming and can leave the bereaved husband feeling lost, confused, and isolated. In a society in which men are often expected to be stoic and unemotional, it can be difficult for the man to express his grief in a way that is socially acceptable.
