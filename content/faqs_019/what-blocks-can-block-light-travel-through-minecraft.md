Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. It is a game where players can build structures and explore vast landscapes. One of the key features of the game is its ability to let players manipulate and control the environment, including the ability to build and break blocks. One of the most popular aspects of the game is its ability to simulate day and night cycles. Players can create structures and environments that block out the sun, allowing them to keep their creations secret. But what blocks can block light travel through Minecraft?

<h2>The Basics of Blocks and Light in Minecraft</h2>

In Minecraft, blocks are the fundamental building blocks of the game. Blocks can be placed, moved, and destroyed.

Transparent blocks allow light to pass through them, while non-transparent blocks do not.
