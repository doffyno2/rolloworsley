<p>Starting a fire with flint is an age-old skill that has been used for centuries by people all over the world.

<h2>What You Will Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, make sure you have all the supplies you need for a successful fire. You will need flint, a striker, tinder, and fuel. Flint is a type of sedimentary rock that produces a spark when struck with a hard object. The striker is the object that you use to strike the flint. It can be made of steel, iron, or any other hard material. Tinder is the material that you lit the spark on, such as dry leaves, pine needles, or cotton balls. Finally, you will need fuel, such as wood or charcoal, to keep the fire going.</p>

<h2>How to Start a Fire with Flint</h2>

<p>Starting a fire with flint is a straightforward process. First, gather together your supplies and make sure you have enough tinder, fuel, and flint to get the job done. Next, find a dry, flat surface and lay out your fuel and tinder. Then, take your flint and striker and strike them together at a 45-degree angle. This should produce sparks, which will light the tinder. Once the tinder is lit, you can add fuel to the fire and keep it going.</p>
