<p>A periodontal abscess is an infection that occurs in the soft tissue of the gums and jawbone.

If left untreated, a periodontal abscess can have serious consequences, so it is important to seek treatment right away. The cost of a periodontal abscess repair will depend on the type of procedure required and the severity of the infection.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Periodontal Abscess?</h2>

<p>Periodontal abscesses are caused by bacteria that accumulate in pockets between the teeth and gum line. These bacteria can form when plaque and tartar build up.

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of a Periodontal Abscess?</h2>

<p>The most common symptom of a periodontal abscess is a severe toothache. Other symptoms include redness and swelling of the gums, bad breath, fever, and a bad taste in the mouth.

<h2>How Is a Periodontal Abscess Diagnosed?</h2>

<p>If you experience any of the symptoms of a periodontal abscess, you should see your dentist right away. Your dentist will examine your mouth and take X-rays to determine the extent of the infection. Your dentist may also take a sample of the pus from the abscess to be sent to a lab for testing. This will help your dentist determine the type of bacteria causing the infection.</p>

<h2>What Are the Treatment Options for a Periodontal Abscess?</h2>

<p>The treatment for a periodontal abscess will depend on the severity of the infection. In mild cases, your dentist may recommend a course of antibiotics.
