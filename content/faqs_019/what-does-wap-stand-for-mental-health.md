#What Does WAP Stand for Mental Health?
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Mental health is an integral part of this definition, and it is important to understand what constitutes good mental health and how to protect it. The acronym WAP stands for “Wellbeing, Awareness, and Protection” and is a framework for understanding and promoting mental health.

##What is Mental Health?
Mental health is a state of psychological and emotional wellbeing. It is the foundation of all aspects of our lives and is the key to achieving our goals and living a fulfilled and meaningful life. Mental health is not just the absence of mental illness or distress, but the presence of positive characteristics such as resilience, optimism, and self-confidence.

##What is the WAP Framework?
The WAP framework is a holistic approach to mental health that includes three key components: Wellbeing, Awareness, and Protection.

###Wellbeing
Wellbeing is the foundation of mental health. It includes physical, mental, and social elements and is essential for overall happiness and wellbeing. Physical wellbeing includes physical activity, healthy nutrition, adequate sleep, and stress management. Mental wellbeing includes the ability to recognize and manage emotions, build supportive relationships, and engage in meaningful activities. Social wellbeing includes the ability to build and maintain positive relationships, participate in social activities, and have a sense of belonging and connectedness.

###Awareness
Awareness is the process of understanding, identifying, and acknowledging mental health concerns. It involves recognizing and understanding signs and symptoms of mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, or depression. It also includes being aware of how lifestyle choices, such as poor nutrition or lack of exercise, can affect mental health.

###Protection
Protection is the process of taking action to maintain good mental health and prevent mental health issues from developing or worsening. This includes developing and maintaining healthy habits, such as getting enough sleep, eating a balanced diet, and engaging in regular physical activity. It also includes recognizing stressors and taking steps to manage them and seeking help when needed.
