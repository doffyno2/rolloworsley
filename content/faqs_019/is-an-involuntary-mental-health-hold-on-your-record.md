An involuntary mental health hold, also known as an emergency detention, is a legal order issued by police or mental health professionals that allows someone to be detained and evaluated for a mental health evaluation. The order is usually issued when a person is deemed to be a danger to themselves or others. It is a temporary measure that is used to protect the individual from harm and to allow for further evaluation and treatment.

<h2>What is the Difference Between an Involuntary Mental Health Hold and an Involuntary Psychiatric Hospitalization?</h2>

An involuntary mental health hold is a temporary measure that lasts for up to 72 hours. During this time, the individual is held in a safe environment and evaluated by mental health professionals. During this period, the individual is not free to leave and must submit to an evaluation and treatment. However, they are not admitted to a psychiatric hospital and are usually released after the 72-hour period.

In contrast, an involuntary psychiatric hospitalization is a more serious measure and involves a longer stay in a psychiatric hospital for evaluation and treatment. This stay can last for up to 14 days and the individual is not free to leave.

<h2>What is the Process of an Involuntary Mental Health Hold?</h2>

The process of an involuntary mental health hold begins with the individual being taken into custody by police or mental health professionals. This can occur due to a report from a friend, family member, teacher, or doctor that the individual is in danger of harming themselves or others. The individual is then taken to a mental health facility or hospital, where they are evaluated by a mental health professional. 

Once the evaluation is complete, the mental health professional will decide if the individual needs to be held for further evaluation and treatment. If so, the individual will be held for up to 72 hours. During this time, the individual is monitored and evaluated by mental health professionals. If the individual is deemed to pose no risk to themselves or others, they are usually released from the facility.

<h2>What Are the Rights of an Individual on an Involuntary Mental Health Hold?</h2>

Individuals on an involuntary mental health hold have certain rights that are protected by law. These rights include the right to a lawyer, the right to access medical care, and the right to be informed of the reasons for their detention. Additionally, individuals on an involuntary mental health hold have the right to refuse medications and treatments, as well as the right to express their views and to be involved in their own care and treatment.

<h2>What Are the Consequences of an Involuntary Mental Health Hold?</h2>

The consequences of an involuntary mental health hold can vary depending on the individual’s situation. In some cases, the individual may be released after the 72-hour period and no further action will be taken. In other cases, the individual may be hospitalized for further evaluation and treatment. Additionally, an involuntary mental health hold can have legal consequences, including the potential for criminal charges.

<h2>What Should Someone Do if They Have Been Placed on an Involuntary Mental Health Hold?</h2>

If an individual has been placed on an involuntary mental health hold, it is important to seek legal advice as soon as possible. A lawyer can provide advice about the individual’s rights and can help to ensure that the individual’s rights are respected during the process.
