Volae recumbents are a type of bicycle designed to provide a more ergonomic, comfortable and efficient riding experience than a traditional upright bicycle. They have been around since the early 1980s and have become a popular choice among bicycle enthusiasts. However, in recent years, the company that produces these bikes, Volae, has been facing some difficult times. In this article, we take a look at what happened to Volae and what the future holds for these unique bikes.

<h2>What is a Volae Recumbent?</h2>

Volae recumbents are a type of bicycle that has a low-slung frame and a seat that is positioned between the frame and the pedals. This design allows for a more comfortable and efficient riding experience, as it places the rider in a more aerodynamic position. The frame also helps to distribute the rider's weight more evenly, reducing fatigue and increasing the rider's power output.

The Volae recumbent was first designed by Jerry Bernhart in the early 1980s. Since then, the company has grown in popularity, and their bikes are now seen in many races and competitions around the world.

<h2>What Happened to Volae?</h2>

In recent years, Volae has faced some difficult times. The company has struggled to keep up with the demand for their bikes, and as a result, they have had to close several stores and lay off workers. This has led to a decrease in sales and an overall decrease in the company's reputation.

The company has also faced some legal issues. In 2018, the company was sued by its former owner, who alleged that the company had not paid him the money he was owed. This lawsuit was eventually settled out of court, but it caused further damage to the company's reputation.

<h2>What is the Future of Volae Recumbents?</h2>

Despite these setbacks, Volae is still producing recumbents and are still a popular choice among bicycle enthusiasts. They are continuing to innovate and develop new designs, and they are dedicated to providing the highest quality of service to their customers.

The future of Volae recumbents is uncertain, but the company is committed to continuing to provide quality bikes and service. They are also continuing to look for ways to increase their presence in the market and to reach more customers.
