Fleas are a common problem for pet owners, especially those with dogs. Fleas can cause a number of health problems, including skin irritation, skin infections, and even anemia. It’s important to know what fleas look like on dogs so that you can take action to protect your pet.

<h2>Signs of Fleas on Dogs</h2>

The most obvious sign that your dog has fleas is if you see them. Fleas are small, dark-colored, wingless parasites that measure 2 to 5 millimeters in length. They are typically brown or black in color and can move quickly. They have long legs that allow them to jump from one host to another. Fleas can also leave behind tiny black or reddish-brown droppings, which are actually flea eggs.

If you do not see any fleas on your dog, there are other signs that you can look for. Your dog may start scratching or biting excessively, or you may notice small red bumps on its skin. You may also see flea dirt, which are black specks left behind by fleas that can be found on your pet’s fur or in its bedding.

<h2>How to Tell If Your Dog Has Fleas</h2>

If you suspect that your dog has fleas, there are a few steps you can take to confirm your suspicions. First, you can use a flea comb to comb through your dog’s fur and look for adult fleas. You can also look for flea eggs or flea dirt in your dog’s bedding or on its fur.

You should also vacuum your house and wash your pet’s bedding frequently.
