Testarossa is a word that is derived from Italian and is used to describe something that is red in color. This term is most commonly used to describe Ferrari cars, particularly those that were built in the 1950s and 1960s. While it is primarily associated with Ferrari, it can also refer to any car that is red in color.

The literal translation of Testarossa from Italian into English is "red head". This is because the car has a red head lining. There are a few different theories about why this particular car was given this name, but the most popular explanation is that it is referring to the red-haired drivers that were seen behind the wheel of the Ferrari Testarossa.

The Testarossa was one of the first Ferrari cars to make use of a mid-engine design. This meant that the engine was placed behind the driver, rather than in front of them. This allowed for improved performance and a more balanced weight distribution. The car was also equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission and a flat-12 engine.
