<p>F10 is an error code that is displayed on the digital display panel of a Frigidaire stove when the temperature sensor or oven temperature has exceeded the set temperature level. This error code can be triggered if the temperature levels within the oven have become too high or if the temperature sensor has failed. It is important to take note of this error code and take the appropriate steps to fix the issue.</p>

<h2>What Causes the F10 Error Code?</h2>

<p>The F10 error code is usually caused by a failed temperature sensor or by the oven temperature rising above the set temperature level. It can also be caused by a faulty relay board, a faulty electronic oven control, or a wiring problem. It is important to determine the cause of the F10 error code in order to fix the issue.</p>

<h2>How to Fix the F10 Error Code</h2>

<p>If you are experiencing the F10 error code on your Frigidaire stove, the first thing you should do is to unplug the appliance and check the temperature sensor. Make sure that the sensor is properly connected and that it is not damaged. If the temperature sensor is damaged, you should replace it with a new one. You can also try resetting the oven by pressing the "Cancel" button and then pressing the "Off/Reset" button.</p>

<h2>What Is the Temperature Sensor in a Frigidaire Stove?</h2>

<p>The temperature sensor in a Frigidaire stove is a small device that is used to measure the internal temperature of the oven. This sensor is connected to the electronic oven control and is responsible for controlling the temperature within the oven. If this sensor fails or becomes damaged, it can cause the F10 error code to be displayed. It is important to replace the sensor if it is faulty in order to resolve the issue.</p>

<h2>What to Do If the F10 Error Code Persists</h2>

<p>If the F10 error code persists after resetting the oven, you should check the wiring and the relay board. Make sure that all of the connections are properly connected and that there are no loose wires. You should also check the electronic oven control for any signs of damage. If the wiring and the relay board are in good condition, you should replace the electronic oven control.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The F10 error code is displayed on a Frigidaire stove when the temperature sensor or oven temperature has exceeded the set temperature level. This error code can be caused by a failed temperature sensor, a faulty relay board, a faulty electronic oven control, or a wiring problem. In order to fix the issue, it is important to determine the cause of the F10 error code and take the appropriate steps to resolve the issue.
