Bikes come in all shapes and sizes, but when it comes to the wheels, there are two main sizes used: 700c and 26 inches. Knowing the difference between the two is important for anyone who is looking to purchase a new bicycle. In this article, we'll explain what 700c means for bikes and how it compares to other wheel sizes.

<h2>What Is 700c?</h2>

700c is a wheel size designation used for road bicycles and other types of bikes. The size is also referred to as 29-inch, although the actual diameter of a 700c wheel is 622 millimeters. This size is by far the most popular for road bikes, as it offers a good balance between speed, comfort, and efficiency.

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of 700c Wheels?</h2>

700c wheels are great for riders who are looking for a fast, efficient ride. The larger diameter allows for a more comfortable ride, as the larger contact patch helps absorb bumps and vibrations. The larger wheel size also means that the bike is more aerodynamic and has less rolling resistance, which can help you go faster with less effort.

<h2>Are 700c Wheels Right For Me?</h2>

700c wheels are best suited for riders who are looking for a fast, efficient ride. They are perfect for long rides and racing, as they offer a great balance between speed, comfort, and efficiency. However, they are not ideal for riders who need a lot of maneuverability, as the larger wheel size can make it harder to turn and navigate tight spaces.

<h2>What Are The Downsides Of 700c Wheels?</h2>

One of the main drawbacks of 700c wheels is that they can be heavier and less maneuverable than smaller wheel sizes. This can make them less suitable for riders who need to be able to quickly change direction or navigate tight spaces. Additionally, the larger wheel size can make the bike more expensive due to the larger components required.

<h2>Are There Other Wheel Sizes?</h2>

Yes, there are other wheel sizes available for bikes. The most common alternative is the 26-inch wheel size, which is used on mountain bikes and other types of bikes. The 26-inch size is smaller than 700c, which makes it lighter and more maneuverable, but also slower and less efficient.

<h2>What Should I Consider When Choosing A Wheel Size?</h2>

When choosing a wheel size for your bike, it’s important to consider your riding style and the terrain you’ll be riding on. If you need a fast, efficient ride, then 700c is probably the best option. If you need a more maneuverable bike that can handle tight spaces and rough terrain, then you may want to opt for the 26-inch size.
