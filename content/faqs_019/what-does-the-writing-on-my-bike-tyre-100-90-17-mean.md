<p>Have you ever wondered what that string of numbers and letters means on the side of your bike tyre? Whether you are an avid cyclist or just an occasional hobbyist, it is important to understand the meaning of the writing on your tyres. In this article, we will discuss what the writing on your bike tyre 100 90 17 means and why it is important for you to know.</p>

<h2>What Does the Writing on My Bike Tyre 100 90 17 Mean?</h2>

<p>The writing on the side of your bike tyre 100 90 17 is actually a combination of three numbers and one letter. The first two numbers (100) refer to the width of your tyre in millimeters. The middle two numbers (90) refer to the aspect ratio of your tyre. The final two numbers (17) refer to the wheel size in inches. The letter at the end (H) refers to the type of tyre construction.</p>

<h3>What Does the Width of My Tyre Mean?</h3>

<p>The first two numbers on your bike tyre (100) refer to the width of your tyre in millimeters. This is an important number to pay attention to because it will affect the overall performance of your bike. A tyre that is too wide will create too much drag and can cause your bike to handle poorly. On the other hand, a tyre that is too narrow can cause your bike to slip and slide in wet weather.</p>

<h3>What Does the Aspect Ratio of My Tyre Mean?</h3>

<p>The aspect ratio of your tyre is represented by the middle two numbers (90). This number refers to the ratio of the width of your tyre to the height of your tyre. This number is important because it will affect the overall handling of your bike. A lower aspect ratio (closer to 50) will create a stiffer tyre and will provide more grip and stability. A higher aspect ratio (closer to 100) will create a softer tyre and will provide more cushioning and comfort.</p>

<h3>What Does the Wheel Size of My Tyre Mean?</h3>

<p>The wheel size of your tyre is represented by the final two numbers (17). This number refers to the size of your wheel in inches. The wheel size is important because it will affect the overall performance of your bike. A larger wheel size will provide more speed and stability, while a smaller wheel size will provide more agility and maneuverability.</p>

<h3>What Does the Type of Tyre Construction Mean?</h3>

<p>The letter at the end of your tyre (H) refers to the type of tyre construction. The most common type of tyre construction is radial, which is represented by the letter R. Radial tyres have a stiffer sidewall and provide better grip and handling. The letter H refers to a type of tyre construction known as bias-ply. Bias-ply tyres have a softer sidewall and provide better cushioning and comfort.</p>
