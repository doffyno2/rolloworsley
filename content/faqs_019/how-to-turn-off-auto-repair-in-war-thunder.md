<p>War Thunder is an online multiplayer combat game that allows you to experience World War II with a wide range of aircrafts, tanks, and other military vehicles. One popular feature in War Thunder is the ability to repair your vehicles while in the middle of a battle.

In this article, we’ll explain how to turn off auto repair in War Thunder so you can focus on the task at hand without worrying about your vehicle’s health.</p>

<h2>Auto Repair in War Thunder</h2>

Fortunately, there is a way to turn off auto repair in War Thunder.</p>

<h2>Turning Off Auto Repair in War Thunder</h2>

<p>The way to turn off auto repair in War Thunder is to simply turn off the “Auto Repair” setting in the game’s settings menu. To access the settings menu, open the in-game menu and select “Settings.” In the settings menu, select the “Game” tab and scroll down until you find the “Auto Repair” option. Uncheck the box next to the “Auto Repair” option and your vehicle will no longer automatically repair itself while in battle.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Turning Off Auto Repair</h2>
