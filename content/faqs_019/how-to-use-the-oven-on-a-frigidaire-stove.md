<p>Using an oven can be intimidating, especially if you’re not familiar with the particular brand or model. If you’ve recently purchased a Frigidaire stove, you may be wondering how to use the oven. Fortunately, Frigidaire ovens are designed to be user-friendly and simple to use. Here’s a comprehensive guide to using the oven on a Frigidaire stove.</p> 

<h2>Setting the Temperature</h2>

<p>The first step in using your Frigidaire oven is to set the temperature. Depending on your model, you may have the option to set the temperature manually or use pre-programmed settings. To manually set the temperature, press the “Temperature” button or the up and down arrows until you reach the temperature you desire. If your model has pre-programmed settings, press the “Program” button to bring up a list of settings and then press the up or down arrows to select the desired setting.</p>

<h2>Using the Bake and Broil Settings</h2>

<p>Once you’ve set the desired temperature, it’s time to choose between the bake and broil settings. To select the bake setting, press the “Bake” button. This will cause the oven to begin heating up to the selected temperature. To select the broil setting, press the “Broil” button. This will cause the oven to heat up to a higher temperature than the bake setting, usually between 500-550 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Timer</h2>

<p>If you’d like to set a timer, press the “Timer” button and then use the up and down arrows to set the desired time. Once the timer is set, the oven will begin to count down. When the timer reaches zero, the oven will turn off automatically.</p>

<h2>Using the Self-Cleaning Feature</h2>

<p>Frigidaire ovens come with a self-cleaning feature, which can make the process of cleaning your oven much easier. To use this feature, press the “Self-Clean” button and then use the up and down arrows to set the cleaning time. Once the cleaning time is set, the oven will begin to heat up to a very high temperature and stay at that temperature for the set amount of time. When the cleaning cycle is complete, the oven will turn off automatically.</p>

<h2>Using the Keep Warm Setting</h2>

<p>The Keep Warm setting is a convenient feature that can be used to keep food warm for extended periods of time. To use this setting, press the “Keep Warm” button and then use the up and down arrows to set the desired time.
