What Color is Pepper Spray?

Pepper spray is a popular and effective self-defense tool that is used by millions of people around the world. It is also known as Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) and is a chemical irritant that can cause severe burning, coughing, and tearing of the eyes. It comes in a variety of colors, but what color is pepper spray?

Pepper spray can be found in both clear and colored varieties. The clear variety is often referred to as “OC spray”, while the colored varieties are known as “pepper spray”. There is no single color that is used for all types of pepper spray, but red and orange are the most common. 

The color of pepper spray is determined by the amount of oleoresin capsicum (OC) in the solution. The higher the concentration of OC, the darker the pepper spray will be. Red pepper spray typically contains the highest concentration of OC, followed by orange, yellow, and green. Clear pepper spray does not contain any OC, so it does not have a color. 

In addition to the color of the pepper spray, the strength of the spray can also affect the color. Pepper sprays with a higher strength will be darker in color, while those with lower strengths will be lighter. For example, a red pepper spray with a strength of 10% OC will be darker than an orange pepper spray with a strength of 5% OC. 

It is important to note that pepper spray does not always appear the same color in all environments. In sunlight, pepper spray may appear lighter or darker than it does in the shade. Additionally, the color of pepper spray can be affected by the age of the canister. Older canisters may have faded in color due to exposure to the elements.
