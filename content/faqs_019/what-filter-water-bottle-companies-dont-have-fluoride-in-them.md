Water is essential for our survival, and the quality of the water we drink can have a major impact on our health. One of the main pollutants in water is fluoride, a mineral found in many sources of drinking water. While fluoride has been touted as beneficial for our teeth, it has also been linked to a wide range of health issues, including thyroid problems, cognitive issues, and even birth defects.

For those looking to avoid fluoride, buying a filter water bottle is a great way to ensure that your drinking water is free from this potentially harmful mineral. But which companies don't have fluoride in their filter water bottles? 

<h2>Why Avoid Fluoride?</h2>

Fluoride is an important mineral for healthy teeth and bones. However, too much fluoride can be harmful to your health. Studies have linked high levels of fluoride to a range of health issues, including thyroid problems, cognitive issues, and even birth defects.
