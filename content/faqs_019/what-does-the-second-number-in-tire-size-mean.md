<p>Tire size is an important factor when it comes to buying new tires, and the numbers and letters used to describe them can be confusing. The second number in tire size is the aspect ratio and it describes the tire's sidewall height as a percentage of its section width. In other words, it is the tire's height from the rim to the top of the tread divided by its width from sidewall to sidewall. </p>

<h2>Understanding Tire Aspect Ratios</h2>

<p>Tire aspect ratios are usually expressed as a percentage and can range from 20 to 90. For example, a tire with an aspect ratio of 65 has a sidewall height that is 65% of the tire's section width. The larger the aspect ratio number, the taller the tire's sidewall will be. In general, lower aspect ratio tires are usually found on high-performance cars, while higher aspect ratios are used on more sedate vehicles.</p>

<p>Tires with tall sidewalls typically offer a smoother ride, as they absorb more of the road's bumps and vibrations. Taller sidewalls also give a car more suspension travel, allowing it to drive over bumps and other obstacles more easily. On the other hand, low-profile tires have stiffer sidewalls that provide better cornering and handling performance.</p>

<h2>How Tire Aspect Ratios Affect Performance</h2>

<p>Tire aspect ratios can have a major impact on a vehicle's performance. Low-profile tires offer better cornering grip and handling because of their stiffer sidewalls, which make the sidewalls less prone to flexing during cornering. These tires also tend to have lower rolling resistance, which can improve acceleration and fuel economy.</p>

<p>High-profile tires, on the other hand, offer a more comfortable ride because of their taller sidewalls, which absorb more of the road's bumps and vibrations. This makes them ideal for long highway trips, but they can be less responsive when cornering and accelerating. High-profile tires also tend to be heavier than low-profile tires, which can negatively affect a vehicle's fuel economy and performance.</p>

<h2>What Does the Third Number in Tire Size Mean?</h2>

<p>The third number in tire size is the wheel diameter and it indicates the size of the wheel that the tire can fit. This number is usually written as a two- or three-digit number and it is measured in inches. For example, a tire with a wheel diameter of 15 means that it can fit on a 15-inch wheel. If the wheel diameter is written as a three-digit number, it usually indicates that the tire is designed for a particular model of car.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Having the Right Tire Size</h2>

<p>Having the right tire size is important for several reasons. First, it ensures that your vehicle will operate safely and efficiently. If the tire is too small, it can lead to a loss of traction and an increased risk of tire failure. On the other hand, if the tire is too large, it can cause excessive wear on the drivetrain and suspension components, leading to premature failure. Having the right tire size also ensures that your vehicle will perform as intended, so it is important to select the right size when buying new tires.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What does the second number in tire size mean?</h3>

<p>The second number in tire size is the aspect ratio and it describes the tire's sidewall height as a percentage of its section width. In other words, it is the tire's height from the rim to the top of the tread divided by its width from sidewall to sidewall.</p>

<h3>How does tire aspect ratio affect ride comfort?</h3>

<h3>Do all tires have the same aspect ratio?</h3>

<p>No, tire aspect ratios can range from 20 to 90. For example, a tire with an aspect ratio of 65 has a sidewall height that is 65% of the tire's section width. The larger the aspect ratio number, the taller the tire's sidewall will be.</p>

<h3>What is the importance of having the correct wheel diameter for a tire?</h3>

<p>Having the correct wheel diameter for a tire is important because it ensures that your vehicle will operate safely and efficiently. If the tire is too small, it can lead to a loss of traction and an increased risk of tire failure. On the other hand, if the tire is too large, it can cause excessive wear on the drivetrain and suspension components, leading to premature failure.</p>
