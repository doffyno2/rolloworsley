War Dogs is a 2016 American biographical dark comedy-drama. The film is loosely based on the true story of two young men, David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli, who won a $300 million contract from the U.S. government to supply arms for allies of the United States in Afghanistan. 

<h2>The True Story of David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli</h2>

David Packouz and Efraim Diveroli were two young men from Miami, Florida. They met in high school and developed a friendship that would eventually lead to a lucrative business venture. In 2005, the two decided to take advantage of a Bush-era loophole in the U.S. government's arms procurement system. The loophole allowed non-traditional defense contractors to bid on government contracts. Taking advantage of this, Packouz and Diveroli founded AEY Inc., a company that specialized in supplying foreign weapons and ammunition to the U.S. military. 

<h2>How AEY Inc. Won a $300 Million U.S. Government Contract</h2>

In 2007, AEY Inc. won a $300 million contract from the U.S. government to supply arms for allies of the United States in Afghanistan. The contract was for the supply of millions of rounds of ammunition and other military equipment. To fulfill the contract, Packouz and Diveroli sourced weapons from various suppliers around the world, including from countries like China, which were not authorized by the U.S. government. 

<h2>The Controversy Surrounding AEY Inc.</h2>

The contract won by AEY Inc. quickly became controversial. The U.S. government accused Packouz and Diveroli of fraud and making false statements in the course of their business dealings. The government also alleged that the two had violated the Arms Export Control Act, which prohibits the sale of weapons to countries not authorized by the U.S. government. 

<h2>The Outcome of the Controversy</h2>

Packouz and Diveroli were eventually arrested and charged with multiple counts of fraud and violating the Arms Export Control Act. Packouz was sentenced to seven months in prison, while Diveroli was sentenced to four years. The two men were also ordered to pay $7.9 million in restitution to the U.S. government. 

<h2>The Film War Dogs</h2>

The controversy surrounding Packouz and Diveroli's business dealings eventually caught the attention of Hollywood filmmakers. In 2016, War Dogs, a biographical dark comedy-drama based loosely on the true story of Packouz and Diveroli, was released. The film was a box office success, grossing over $86 million worldwide.
