<p>When it comes to food safety, there is no question that you should always be aware of the expiration dates on the food you purchase. However, sometimes the “sell by” date or the “use by” date can be confusing. So, the question is, can you eat fish past its sell by date?</p>

<p>The answer is a bit complicated and depends on a few different factors. First, it is important to note that the “sell by” date is usually determined by the store that is selling the product. This date is typically based on the best-by date for the item and is meant to indicate when the product should be sold and removed from the shelves. This does not necessarily mean that the fish is bad or unsafe to eat after this date.</p>

<p>The “use by” date, on the other hand, is the date that is determined by the manufacturer and is meant to indicate when the food should no longer be eaten. This date is typically more reliable than the “sell by” date. If you are in doubt about whether or not the fish is still safe to eat, the best thing to do is to use your best judgement.</p>

<p>When it comes to fish, the “use by” date is usually two days after the “sell by” date. This means that if you purchase the fish on the “sell by” date, you should plan to use it within two days. However, if the fish was frozen when you purchased it, it may be safe to eat for up to three months after the “sell by” date. Keep in mind, however, that the quality of the fish will decrease over time and it may not be as fresh or flavorful as it was when you purchased it.</p>

<p>When it comes to determining whether or not a fish is safe to eat past its “sell by” or “use by” date, it is important to use your best judgement. If the fish does not smell or look fresh, it is best to discard it. Additionally, be sure to check the temperature of the fish before consuming it. If the fish has been left out at room temperature for more than two hours, it should not be eaten.</p>

<h2>Steps To Take To Ensure The Fish Is Safe To Eat</h2>

<p>When it comes to eating fish past its “sell by” or “use by” date, there are a few steps you can take to ensure that the fish is safe to eat. First, check the temperature of the fish. If it has been left out at room temperature for more than two hours, it is best to discard it. Additionally, check the color and smell of the fish. If either is off, it is best to discard it.</p>

<p>If the fish looks and smells fresh, you can cook it and check the temperature with a food thermometer. Fish is safe to eat once it reaches an internal temperature of 145°F. If the fish does not reach this temperature, it is best to discard it.</p>

<h2>How To Store Fish Properly</h2>

<p>To ensure that your fish is safe to eat, it is important to store it properly. Fresh fish should be stored in the coldest part of your refrigerator, typically the bottom shelf. When storing fish, be sure to wrap it securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil. If the fish will not be used within two days, it should be frozen.</p>

<p>If you are freezing the fish, be sure to wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and place it in a sealed container or freezer bag. The fish should be stored at 0°F or below. If you are freezing the fish for more than three months, it is best to wrap it in an additional layer of plastic wrap or aluminum foil.</p>
