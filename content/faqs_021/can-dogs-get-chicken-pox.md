Can Dogs Get Chicken Pox?

The question of whether or not dogs can get chicken pox has been around for quite some time. The answer is that yes, dogs can get chicken pox, but it is rare. The virus that causes chicken pox in humans is not the same virus that causes chicken pox in dogs. In other words, humans and dogs cannot pass the virus to each other.

Chicken pox in dogs is caused by a virus known as canine distemper virus (CDV). CDV is highly contagious and is transmitted through bodily fluids, such as saliva and nasal secretions. It can also be transmitted through contact with contaminated objects, such as bedding or toys.



The signs and symptoms of chicken pox in dogs can vary greatly. Some of the most common symptoms include:

<h2>Fever</h2>
A fever is one of the most common signs of chicken pox in dogs. A dog’s temperature may rise as high as 104-106°F (40-41°C).

<h2>Lethargy</h2>
Dogs with chicken pox may become lethargic and lack energy. They may also be unwilling to move or play.

<h2>Loss of Appetite</h2>
A loss of appetite is another common symptom of chicken pox in dogs. Dogs may refuse to eat or may only pick at their food.

<h2>Coughing</h2>
Dogs with chicken pox may have a persistent dry cough. This is due to the virus irritating the lining of the airways.

<h2>Sneezing</h2>
Sneezing is also a common symptom of chicken pox in dogs. This is due to the virus irritating the lining of the nose.

<h2>Skin Lesions</h2>
The most obvious sign of chicken pox in dogs is the presence of skin lesions. These lesions may appear as small, red bumps on the skin. They may also be accompanied by itching and irritation.



If you suspect your dog may have chicken pox, it’s important to take them to the vet for an examination. Your vet will ask about your dog’s symptoms and will perform a physical examination. They may also take a sample of fluid from the lesions to test for the presence of the virus.



The treatment for chicken pox in dogs is typically supportive care. This may include medications to reduce fever, pain, and inflammation. It may also include fluids to prevent dehydration and antibiotics to prevent secondary infections.

In severe cases, your vet may recommend hospitalization and oxygen therapy. This is to help your dog breathe more easily and to reduce the risk of complications.



The best way to prevent chicken pox in dogs is to keep them up to date on their vaccinations. Vaccines are available that can protect dogs from the virus that causes chicken pox.

It’s also important to keep your dog away from other dogs that may be infected. This is especially important if your dog is not vaccinated.
