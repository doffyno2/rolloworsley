Can I Use Bottled Water in My CPAP?

It's no secret that using a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine can be a life-saver for those suffering from sleep apnea. But what many CPAP users may not know is that there are certain rules and regulations they must follow to ensure they are getting the most out of their machine. One of the most important rules is to only use distilled or purified water in their CPAP.

Many CPAP users may be wondering if it's possible to use bottled water in their CPAP machines, and the short answer is no. Bottled water is not suitable for use in a CPAP machine, as it usually contains minerals and other contaminants that can damage the machine and reduce its effectiveness.

In this article, we'll explore why you should only use distilled or purified water in your CPAP, and how to go about obtaining it.

<h2>Why Should I Only Use Distilled or Purified Water in My CPAP?</h2>

Using distilled or purified water in your CPAP is important for several reasons. The most important reason is that it ensures the machine is free of impurities, which can damage the machine over time and reduce its effectiveness. In addition, distilled or purified water helps to reduce the buildup of bacteria and other contaminants in the water chamber and tubing, which can lead to respiratory infections.

<h2>What is the Difference Between Distilled Water and Purified Water?</h2>

Distilled water and purified water are both safe for use in CPAP machines, but there are some key differences between the two. Distilled water is created by boiling water and collecting the steam, which leaves behind any impurities that may be present in the water. Purified water, on the other hand, is created by passing water through a series of filters that remove impurities, such as chlorine, lead, and other contaminants. 

<h2>Where Can I Obtain Distilled or Purified Water for My CPAP?</h2>

Distilled or purified water can be purchased at most supermarkets, drugstores, and health food stores. It is also available online from a variety of retailers. When purchasing distilled or purified water, be sure to check the label to ensure it is suitable for use in a CPAP machine.

<h2>What Else Should I Know About Using Distilled or Purified Water in My CPAP?</h2>

It's important to note that distilled or purified water should only be used in CPAP machines that have been designed for use with this type of water. If your CPAP machine does not specifically state that it can use distilled or purified water, it is best to consult the manufacturer or your physician before using it.

In addition, it's important to change the water in your CPAP machine regularly. Depending on your usage, this could be anywhere from once a week to once a month. Additionally, the water chamber and tubing should be thoroughly cleaned and dried each time you change the water.
