<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is an action role-playing video game that was developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth installment in The Elder Scrolls series, and was released in November 2011. The game's main story revolves around the character's efforts to defeat Alduin, a dragon who is prophesied to destroy the world. In the game, players can explore the fictional open-world province of Skyrim, which is divided into nine distinct regions. One of the regions is the Rift, which is home to the city of Riften and the castle of Gaius Maro. </p>

<p>Gaius Maro is an important character in the game, as he is a powerful Imperial General and the leader of the Imperial Legion in the Rift.
