<p>Betta fish, or Siamese fighting fish, are an incredibly popular species of aquarium fish. They are known for their bright colors, long fins, and aggressive behavior. But can they live in the same tank with an assorted molly? The answer is usually no, but there are some scenarios where it could work.</p>

<h2>Why Can't Betta Fish Live with Assorted Mollies?</h2>

<p>The simple answer is that betta fish and mollies are not compatible. Betta fish are solitary creatures and do not do well in groups. Mollies, on the other hand, are schooling fish and need to live in groups of at least four. When placed in the same tank, betta fish will be territorial and could become aggressive towards the mollies. This can lead to stress for both species and can even cause serious injury or death.</p>

<h2>Can Betta Fish and Mollies Live Together Under the Right Conditions?</h2>

<p>It is possible for betta fish and mollies to live together, but it requires careful planning and a large tank. The tank should be at least 30 gallons and preferably larger. It should also be heavily planted to give the fish places to hide and to reduce the chances of aggression. The tank should also have plenty of hiding places, such as caves and driftwood, for the betta fish. Finally, the tank should be well-filtered to keep the water quality high.</p>

<p>In addition to a large tank, the betta fish and mollies should be of the same size and age. If the mollies are larger and more mature than the betta fish, they could become aggressive towards it. Similarly, if the betta fish is larger and more mature than the mollies, it could become aggressive towards them. It is important to select fish of similar age and size in order to reduce the chances of aggression.</p>

<p>It is also important to select a species of molly that is not overly active. Active mollies can be too much for the betta fish and could lead to aggression. Slow-moving mollies, such as the sailfin molly, are a better choice for betta fish tanks.</p>

<h2>What if the Betta Fish and Mollies Don't Get Along?</h2>

<p>If the betta fish and mollies start fighting, it is important to separate them as soon as possible. This can be done by setting up a separate tank for the betta fish or by placing a divider in the tank. The divider should be tall enough to prevent the fish from jumping over it and should have small holes to allow water to flow through. After separating the fish, it is important to monitor them closely to make sure that they are not fighting.</p>

<h2>What Other Fish Can Live with a Betta Fish?</h2>

<p>Betta fish are generally not compatible with other fish, but there are a few species that can live peacefully with them. These include slow-moving species such as white cloud mountain minnows, neon tetras, and corydoras catfish. These fish should be added to the tank in small groups and should be monitored closely to make sure that they are not fighting with the betta fish.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Betta fish and assorted mollies can live together under the right conditions, but it is usually not recommended. Betta fish are solitary creatures and can become aggressive towards mollies. The tank should be at least 30 gallons, heavily planted, and have plenty of hiding places for the betta fish. It is also important to select fish of similar size and age and to monitor them closely to make sure they are not fighting. If the fish start fighting, it is important to separate them as soon as possible.</p>
