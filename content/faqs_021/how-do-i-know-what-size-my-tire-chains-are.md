<p>Tire chains are an essential safety tool that provide additional traction and stability to vehicles during winter and other inclement weather driving conditions. While they are essential for safe travel during icy and snowy conditions, it is important to ensure that your tire chains are the correct size for your tires. If you don’t use the correct size, you won’t be able to get the best performance from your tire chains. Here, we provide a guide to help you figure out what size tire chains are right for your vehicle.</p>

<h2>What Size Tire Chain Do I Need?</h2>

<p>The size of the tire chains you need depends on the size of your tires. Tire chains typically come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. Small tire chains are designed for tires that measure 13 to 16 inches in diameter. Medium tire chains are designed for tires that measure 17 to 19 inches in diameter. And large tire chains are designed for tires that measure 20 inches or more in diameter.</p>

<h2>How Do I Measure My Tire Size?</h2>

<p>To determine the size of your tires, you need to measure the diameter of your tires. To do this, you will need to measure the outer diameter of the tire, including the depth of the tread. To measure the diameter, place a straight edge or ruler along the tread of the tire and measure from the bottom of the tire to the top. Make sure to take into account the depth of the tread when measuring. Once you have your measurement, you can determine the size of your tire chain.</p>

<h2>How To Install Tire Chains</h2>

<p>Once you’ve determined the size of your tire chains, you can begin to install them. The first step is to place the chains around the circumference of the tire, making sure that they are centered on the tire. You should also make sure that the chains are not twisted or tangled. Once the chains are in place, you can secure them with the included tensioners. Finally, make sure to secure the chains with the included clips. This will ensure that the chains stay in place while you drive.</p>

<h2>Safety Tips For Using Tire Chains</h2>

<p>Once you’ve installed your tire chains, it’s important to keep in mind a few safety tips. First, never exceed the maximum speed limit when using tire chains. Tire chains are designed for slow speeds and can become dangerous at higher speeds. Second, always make sure to check your tire chains before each trip to ensure that they are properly secured and free of any damage or wear. Finally, never drive on dry pavement with tire chains. This can cause damage to your vehicle and your chains.</p>
