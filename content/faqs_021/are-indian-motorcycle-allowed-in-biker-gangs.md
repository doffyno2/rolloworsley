Are Indian Motorcycles allowed in Biker Gangs?

The question of whether Indian Motorcycles are allowed in biker gangs is a complex one. While there is no single answer, it is important to understand the history and current state of Indian Motorcycle culture in order to get a better understanding of the issue.

What is an Indian Motorcycle?

Indian Motorcycles are a brand of motorcycles that were first produced in 1901 by the Hendee Manufacturing Company. The company was later renamed to the Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company and produced some of the most iconic motorcycles of the early 20th century. The company had a long and successful run in the United States until it closed in 1953.

Since then, several companies have tried to revive the Indian Motorcycle brand, with varying levels of success. The most successful of these companies is currently the Indian Motorcycle Company, which was founded in 2011 and is now owned by Polaris Industries.

Are Indian Motorcycles allowed in Biker Gangs?

The answer to this question is not a simple yes or no. The current state of Indian Motorcycle culture is one of tolerance and acceptance, but that does not mean that Indian Motorcycles are universally accepted into biker gangs.

The truth is that the majority of biker gangs have a strict code of acceptance that does not include Indian Motorcycles. This code is based on a variety of factors, including the gang’s history, its desired reputation, and its members’ personal preferences.

In some cases, Indian Motorcycles may be allowed in biker gangs, but only if the gang agrees that the rider is a suitable member. This could mean that the rider has a strong understanding of biker culture and etiquette, and is willing to abide by the gang’s rules and regulations.

However, some biker gangs may not accept any motorcycles other than Harley-Davidson, due to their long history with the brand. Even if a rider has a great appreciation for the Indian Motorcycle brand, they may still be rejected by some gangs.

In some cases, Indian Motorcycles may be accepted into biker gangs, but only as a secondary machine. This means that the rider would be required to have a Harley-Davidson as their primary motorcycle and an Indian Motorcycle as a secondary machine.

In addition to the acceptance of Indian Motorcycles, some biker gangs may also have a dress code that does not include Indian Motorcycle apparel. This could include a ban on Indian Motorcycle patches, t-shirts, and other items that display the Indian Motorcycle logo.
