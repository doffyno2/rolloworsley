<p>Nalgene bottles are made from a type of plastic called polycarbonate, which has become popular for use in water bottles due to its lightweight and durable properties. This type of plastic has been used in the production of Nalgene bottles since the 1970s and has since become one of the most popular brands of reusable water bottles. However, many people have wondered if Nalgene bottles can hold boiling water, or if they are safe to use with hot liquids.</p>

<p>The answer is yes, Nalgene bottles can hold boiling water. Nalgene bottles are made with a special type of plastic that is able to withstand high temperatures without melting or breaking. This special type of plastic is called polycarbonate and is extremely durable and resistant to wear and tear. Additionally, Nalgene bottles are also BPA-free, meaning that they do not contain any of the harmful chemicals that have been linked to certain health risks.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Nalgene bottles are able to hold boiling water, there are still some safety precautions that should be taken when using them. It is important to make sure that the opening of the bottle is tightly sealed before pouring boiling water into it. Additionally, it is best to use a lid or cover on the Nalgene bottle when pouring in boiling water. This will help to reduce the amount of steam that is released and also help to keep the bottle from becoming too hot to handle.</p>

<h2>Are Nalgene Bottles Safe to Use With Hot Liquids?</h2>
