<p>Black Desert is a unique and expansive MMORPG set in a living, breathing world. It has an incredible range of character customization and intricate crafting systems, but one of its most delightful features is the ability to dye your armor and clothes. Dyeing your gear allows you to customize your character and make them stand out in the world. In this guide, we will go over how to dye your gear in Black Desert.</p>

<h2>Getting Started With Dyeing</h2>

<p>To begin dyeing your gear, you must first acquire the necessary equipment: a dye, a dye bottle, and a dye kit. The dye can be purchased from a dye master in the cities of Calpheon, Heidel, and Altinova. Dye bottles can be crafted using alchemy, and dye kits can be crafted using carpentry. Once you have the necessary equipment, you can begin dyeing your gear.</p>

<h2>Dyeing Your Gear</h2>

<p>After you have acquired the necessary equipment, you can begin dyeing your gear. To do so, open your inventory and select the item you wish to dye. Once selected, click the dye icon, which looks like a paintbrush, to open the dyeing window. In the dyeing window, you can select the dye you wish to use and the color you wish to apply. Once you have chosen your dye and color, click the “Apply” button to apply the dye to the item.</p>

<h2>Additional Dye Options</h2>

<p>In addition to the basic dye system, Black Desert also offers several additional dye options. These include dye kits, which allow you to add additional effects to your dyeing, such as sparkles or patterns. These kits can be purchased from a dye master or crafted using carpentry. Additionally, you can use special dyes to create unique looks, such as the “Vibrant” and “Vivid” dyes, which are available from the Marketplace.</p>

<h2>Storing Dyes</h2>

<p>Once you have acquired your dyes, you will need to store them in a safe place. The best way to do this is by keeping them in a dye bottle. Dye bottles can be crafted using alchemy, and you can store up to five dyes in each bottle. Additionally, you can store dyes in your warehouse, though you will need to purchase storage slots to do so.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Your Gear</h2>

<p>Once you have finished dyeing your gear, you will need to clean it. To do so, you can use the “Clean” option in the dyeing window. This will remove any dye from the item and return it to its original color. Alternatively, you can also purchase a dye remover from a dye master, which will also remove any dye from the item.</p>
