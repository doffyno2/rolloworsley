<p>Discus fish are some of the most beautiful creatures in the aquarium hobby, and they are a great addition to any tank. However, they can be difficult to keep because they require a specific water temperature and pH. There is also the question of whether or not they can be kept with other fish, such as guppies. Can discus fish be kept with guppies?</p>

<h2>What Are Discus Fish?</h2>

<p>Discus fish are a type of cichlid that are native to the Amazon River. They are a very popular fish for aquariums because of their unique shape and bright colors. Discus are usually kept in tanks with a pH between 6.5 and 7.5, and a temperature between 77 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. They are also known for being very sensitive to changes in water conditions, so it is important to monitor the water quality in the tank closely.</p>

<h2>What Are Guppies?</h2>

<p>Guppies are small, brightly colored fish that are found in both freshwater and saltwater aquariums. They are a popular choice for beginner aquarists because they are easy to care for and very colorful. Guppies prefer a pH between 7.0 and 8.0, and a temperature between 72 and 79 degrees Fahrenheit. They are also very hardy fish, so they can tolerate a wide range of water conditions.</p>

<h2>Can Discus Fish Be Kept With Guppies?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes, discus fish can be kept with guppies. However, it is important to keep in mind that discus fish are very sensitive to changes in water conditions, so it is important to make sure that the tank conditions are suitable for both fish. The pH should be between 6.5 and 7.5, and the temperature should be between 77 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. If the water conditions are not suitable, then it is best to keep the two species in separate tanks.</p>

<h2>How To Set Up A Tank For Discus And Guppies</h2>

<p>Setting up a tank for discus and guppies can be a bit tricky, since both species have different requirements. It is important to make sure that the tank is big enough for both species, and that the water conditions are suitable for both.

It is also important to make sure that the tank is well-filtered and has plenty of hiding places for the discus.</p>

<p>It is also important to feed the discus and the guppies separately. Discus fish are carnivorous, so they should be fed a high-quality, meaty diet. Guppies, on the other hand, are omnivores, so they should be fed a variety of foods, including brine shrimp, bloodworms, and other frozen foods. It is also important to make sure that the discus and guppies are not competing for food, as this can cause aggression between the two species.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, discus fish can be kept with guppies, as long as the tank conditions are suitable for both species. It is important to make sure that the tank is big enough for both species, and that the water conditions are suitable for both.
