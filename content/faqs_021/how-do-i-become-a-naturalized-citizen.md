<p>The process of becoming a naturalized citizen can be a long one. But, with careful planning and preparation, you can become a naturalized citizen of the United States. This article will explain the process and the requirements for naturalization.</p>

<h2>What is Naturalization?</h2>

<p>Naturalization is the process of becoming a citizen of a country other than the one in which you were born. A person who is naturalized becomes a United States citizen with many of the same rights and privileges as a person who was born in the U.S. </p>

<h2>Who is Eligible for Naturalization? </h2>

<p>In order to be eligible for naturalization, an individual must meet certain criteria. These criteria include:  </p>

<ul>
  <li>Being at least 18 years old.</li>
  <li>Being a permanent resident for at least five years.</li>
  <li>Demonstrating “good moral character”.</li>
  <li>Passing an English and civics exam.</li>
  <li>Having a basic understanding of U.S. history and government.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Application Process</h2>

<p>The first step in the naturalization process is to complete an official application form. This form, known as Form N-400, can be obtained from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The form will ask for basic information about the applicant, such as their name, address, date of birth, and other personal information. The form will also ask for information about the applicant’s family history and previous trips outside the United States. </p>

<p>Once the form is completed, it must be filed with the USCIS. Along with the form, the applicant must also submit supporting documentation, such as proof of legal residence and proof of good moral character. The form and supporting documents must be submitted to the USCIS within the allotted time period. </p>

<h2>The Interview</h2>

<p>After the form and supporting documents are submitted, the applicant will be scheduled for an interview. During the interview, the applicant will be asked questions about their background, their application, and their knowledge of U.S. history and government. The applicant must answer all questions truthfully and accurately. </p>

<p>The interview is also used to determine the applicant’s English ability. During the interview, the applicant will be asked to read and write a few sentences in English. The USCIS officer will also ask the applicant questions in English to determine their understanding of the language. </p>

<h2>The Oath of Allegiance</h2>

<p>Once the applicant has passed the interview, they will be required to take the Oath of Allegiance. This oath affirms the applicant’s loyalty to the United States and its government. Upon taking the oath, the applicant will officially become a naturalized citizen of the United States.</p>
