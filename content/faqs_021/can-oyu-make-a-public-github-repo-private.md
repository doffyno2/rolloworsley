# Can You Make a Public Github Repo Private?

Github is one of the most popular and widely used version control systems in the world. It’s used by millions of developers and organizations to manage their code and collaborate on projects. But what happens when you want to make a Github repo private? Is it possible to change the visibility of a public repo to private?

In this article, we’ll explore the different ways you can make a public Github repo private. We’ll also look at the advantages and disadvantages of doing so and how you can ensure your repo remains private.

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online platform that allows developers and organizations to store and manage their code. It’s a distributed version control system that makes it easy to collaborate on projects with others. 

GitHub also provides a robust set of features that allow users to manage their code, collaborate on projects, and share their code with others. It’s also integrated with a variety of services and tools, such as CI/CD pipelines, project management systems, and bug tracking tools.

## What is a Public Github Repo?

A public Github repo is a repository that is publicly accessible and can be seen by anyone. It’s typically used to share code with other developers or organizations, or to make it available to the public.

When you create a public repo, anyone can view and download the code in the repo. They can also submit changes and suggestions to the code in the repo, or even create their own version of the repo.

## Can You Make a Public Github Repo Private?

Yes, it is possible to make a public Github repo private. To do this, you’ll need to use the “Settings” page in your repo. On this page, you’ll be able to change the visibility of your repo from public to private.

When you make a repo private, it will no longer be visible to anyone but you and any collaborators you’ve added to the repo.

## Advantages of Making a Public Github Repo Private

Making a public Github repo private has a number of advantages. 

The first is that it will allow you to keep your code secure. By making the repo private, you can ensure that only those you’ve granted access to the repo are able to view and download the code. This will help protect your code from being accessed by unauthorized users.

Another advantage of making a public Github repo private is that it will allow you to keep your code private. By making the repo private, you can ensure that your code is not publicly visible or accessible. This can be especially useful if you’re working on a project that you don’t want to be made public until it’s ready.

Finally, making a public Github repo private can also help you ensure that only those you’ve chosen to collaborate with have access to the repo. This can be beneficial if you’re working on a project with a small team and don’t want outsiders to be able to view or download the code.

## Disadvantages of Making a Public Github Repo Private

Making a public Github repo private does have some potential disadvantages. 

The first is that it can limit the visibility of your code. If you make a repo private, it won’t be publicly visible or accessible. This can make it more difficult for other developers or organizations to discover and use your code.

Another potential disadvantage is that it can limit collaboration. If you make a repo private, it won’t be possible for anyone outside of your team to contribute to the code in the repo. This can make it more difficult to get feedback and input from others.

Finally, making a public Github repo private can also be more time consuming. You’ll need to manually add collaborators to the repo and manage the permissions for each user. This can add an extra layer of complexity to your workflow.

## How to Ensure Your Public Github Repo Remains Private

Once you’ve made a public Github repo private, it’s important to ensure that it remains private. Here are some tips for doing so:

- Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication. This will help protect your repo from unauthorized access.

- Regularly review the permissions for each user. This will help ensure that only those you’ve granted access to the repo are able to view and edit the code.

- Use private branches for sensitive code. This will help keep your code secure and prevent it from being publicly visible.

- Use a code review process for changes. This will help ensure that any changes to the code in the repo are reviewed and approved before they’re made public.
