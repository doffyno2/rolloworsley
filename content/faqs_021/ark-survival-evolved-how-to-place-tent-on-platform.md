<p>Ark: Survival Evolved is an open-world survival game that has become popular in recent years. The game puts you in the shoes of a prehistoric survivor, and you must build, craft, and survive in a harsh ancient environment. One of the important game mechanics is the ability to construct a shelter, and the most basic of these is the tent. Here is a guide to building and placing a tent on a platform in Ark: Survival Evolved.</p>

<h2>Building a Tent</h2>

<p>The first step in building a tent is to craft the necessary materials. To do this, you need to have the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>50 thatch</li>
  <li>25 wood</li>
  <li>50 fiber</li>
</ul>

<p>These items can be found in the environment or harvested from creatures. Once you have the necessary materials, you can craft the tent at a crafting station. The tent will then appear in your inventory.</p>

<h2>Placing the Tent on a Platform</h2>

<p>Once you have crafted the tent, it can be placed on any flat surface, including a platform. To do this, you will need to have a platform saddle. This saddle can be crafted at a smithy or purchased from other players. Once you have the saddle, you can equip it and use it to place the tent on the platform. You will need to use the “Place Structures” command to do this. Once you have placed the tent, you will be able to use it as a shelter.</p>

<h2>Advantages of Placing a Tent on a Platform</h2>

<p>Placing a tent on a platform has a number of advantages. Firstly, it provides a more secure shelter than a regular tent. The platform will offer additional protection from predators, as they will not be able to reach it. Secondly, it will also provide additional storage space, as the tent can be used to store items. Finally, it can also be used as a base of operations, as it can be used to craft items, cook food, and store resources.</p>

<h2>Disadvantages of Placing a Tent on a Platform</h2>

<p>Although there are advantages to placing a tent on a platform, there are also a few disadvantages. Firstly, it will require more resources to construct a platform than just a regular tent. Secondly, it will also require more time and effort to construct the platform. Finally, it may make it harder to move the tent if you decide to relocate.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Placing a tent on a platform in Ark: Survival Evolved can offer many advantages, such as greater security and additional storage space. However, it can also require more resources and take more time to construct. Ultimately, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth building a platform for your tent.</p>
