Tuna is one of the most popular fish in the world and it is also one of the most sought after fish for both recreational and commercial fishers. But are tuna freshwater fish? The answer to this question is not as simple as it may seem, as there are two main types of tuna: freshwater and saltwater.

<h2>Freshwater Tuna</h2>

Freshwater tuna are species of tuna that live in freshwater lakes, rivers and streams. These fish are usually found in the northern hemisphere in countries such as Canada, Russia, and the United States.

They can also be distinguished from saltwater tuna by their lighter color, which is usually gray or silver.

Freshwater tuna are typically found in the lower levels of lakes and rivers, where they feed on small fish, insects, and other aquatic organisms. These fish are also known to be shy and will hide when threatened, so it can be difficult to catch them.

<h2>Saltwater Tuna</h2>

Saltwater tuna are species of tuna that live in the open ocean, usually around the tropics and subtropics. These fish are much larger than freshwater tuna, growing up to seven feet in length and weighing up to 500 pounds. They are also more colorful, with blue and green stripes on their sides.

Saltwater tuna feed on small fish, squid, and other oceanic organisms. They are usually found in large schools and are much more aggressive than freshwater tuna. They are also much more active, often seen leaping out of the water in search of food.
