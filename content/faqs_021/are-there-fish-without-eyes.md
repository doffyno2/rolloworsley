Whether it’s an old wives’ tale or an urban legend, most people have heard the phrase “blind as a bat”. However, surprisingly, there are fish that exist without eyes. While this may seem hard to believe, there are many species of fish that have evolved to live with no eyesight. In this article, we will explore why some fish do not have eyes, the different species of fish that are blind, and how they are able to survive without eyesight.

<h2>What Causes Fish to Lose Their Eyesight?</h2>

There are several reasons why fish may be born without eyes. The first is environmental factors. If a fish is born in an area that has low or no light, like a cave, then the fish will not need eyes to survive. Another reason is due to genetic mutations. Mutations in the genes that control development can cause a fish to be born without eyes. Lastly, there are some species of fish that are naturally blind due to their evolution.

<h2>Species of Fish Without Eyes</h2>

One species of fish without eyes is the Mexican Blind Cave Tetra (Astyanax mexicanus). This fish is found in Mexican caves and is the only species of its kind. It is a small fish that grows to around two inches in length and is cream-colored. It has a long, slender body with a small mouth and no eyes. 

Another species of fish without eyes is the Cave Catfish (Cambarellus shufeldtii). This species of fish is found in freshwater rivers and streams in Central America. It has a long, flat body with a small mouth and no eyes. It is a small fish that grows to about four inches in length and is brown in color.

The third species of fish without eyes is the Blind Cave Loach (Amblyopsis spelaea). This species of fish is found in caves in the United States. It is a small fish that grows to about two inches in length and is tan in color. It has a slender body with a small mouth and no eyes. 

The fourth species of fish without eyes is the Blind Cave Eel (Typhlichthys subterraneus). This species of fish is found in caves in North America. It is a small fish that grows to about four inches in length and is gray in color. It has a long, slender body with a small mouth and no eyes.

<h2>How Do Fish Without Eyes Survive?</h2>

Fish without eyes are able to survive and thrive without eyesight because they have evolved to do so. They have highly developed senses of smell and taste, which they use to find food and navigate in their environment. They also use their lateral line to sense vibrations in the water, which helps them to detect predators and prey. 

<h2>Do Fish Without Eyes Have Any Advantages?</h2>

Fish without eyes may have some advantages over their sighted counterparts. For example, they may be more efficient at finding food and avoiding predators since they do not have to waste energy looking for things. Additionally, since they do not have eyes, they do not need to worry about damage to their eyes from predators or the environment. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Fish without eyes are a fascinating and unique species of fish that have evolved to survive without eyesight. They have highly developed senses of smell and taste, as well as their lateral line, which they use to find food and detect predators and prey. Additionally, they may even have a few advantages over their sighted counterparts.
