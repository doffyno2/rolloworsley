<p>Raccoons are incredibly intelligent, curious creatures that have adapted to urban and suburban environments. They are also incredibly agile and have a unique ability to climb up walls and other vertical surfaces. So, the answer to the question, “Can raccoons climb up walls?” is yes, raccoons can climb up walls. But how do they do it?</p>

<h2>How Do Raccoons Climb Up Walls?</h2>

<p>Raccoons have several physical traits that help them to climb up walls. They have sharp claws on their front feet that help them grip surfaces and climb. They also have very flexible front paws that can be used to grip the sides of walls and grab onto small crevices. Additionally, raccoons have semi-retractable claws that help them stay firmly attached to vertical surfaces. Their thick fur helps cushion their feet and claws, allowing them to climb more easily.</p>

<p>Raccoons also use their hind legs to push off from walls when climbing. By pushing off from the surface with their back legs, they can propel themselves up the wall and grab onto higher surfaces with their front legs. This pushing off from the wall is what allows them to climb higher up walls. This method is known as the “hand over hand” technique.</p>

<p>Finally, raccoons have a very powerful sense of smell that helps them to detect food and other resources. This helps them to determine the best places to climb up walls and access resources. For example, if they smell food on the roof of a building, they might use the walls of the building to climb up to the roof and get at the food.</p>
