<p>When you're planning to take a flight on Delta, it's important to know what you can and can't bring with you on the plane. One of the most common items people want to bring on planes is a carry-on and a backpack. Here, we'll discuss the Delta carry-on and backpack policy, so you can make sure you don't have any problems when you fly.</p>

<h2>Delta Carry-On Policy</h2>

<p>Delta allows you to bring one carry-on bag and one personal item on all flights. The personal item must fit under the seat in front of you, and the carry-on must fit in the overhead bins. Your personal item can be a purse, briefcase, laptop bag, or other similar item. Your carry-on can be a suitcase, duffel bag, or other similar item.</p>

<p>Your carry-on must also meet certain size requirements. Your carry-on must not exceed a total of 45 linear inches (length + width + height). The total weight of your carry-on must not exceed 40 lbs. If your bag is too large or too heavy, it will not be allowed on the plane.</p>

You cannot pack any sharp objects, guns, or hazardous materials in your backpack. You also cannot pack any items that are prohibited by the TSA, such as firearms and explosives.
