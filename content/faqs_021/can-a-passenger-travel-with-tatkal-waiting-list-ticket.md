<p>Travelling by train is an important part of life for many people in India. It is a convenient, affordable and comfortable way of getting around. However, booking a train ticket is not always as simple as it seems. One of the most common issues that people encounter is not being able to book a ticket for their desired journey due to a lack of availability. This is where the Tatkal scheme comes in. Tatkal is a system that allows passengers to book tickets at the last minute, usually one day before the journey. But can you travel on a Tatkal waiting list ticket?</p>

<h2>What is a Tatkal Waiting List Ticket?</h2>

<p>A Tatkal waiting list ticket is a ticket for which the booking is made at the last minute. This ticket is issued when all the seats on a particular train are filled and it is not possible to book a confirmed ticket. In this case, the ticketing system will issue a Tatkal waiting list ticket. This ticket will have the same fare as a confirmed ticket and it will be valid up to the end of the journey. However, the passenger will not be able to board the train until their ticket is confirmed. This is done on a first-come-first-served basis and the number of tickets that can be issued in this manner is limited.</p>

<h2>What Happens if Your Tatkal Waiting List Ticket is Not Confirmed?</h2>

<p>If a Tatkal waiting list ticket is not confirmed, then the passenger will not be able to board the train. They will have to cancel the ticket and get a refund from the ticketing system. The refund amount will depend on the time of cancellation and the terms and conditions specified by the Indian Railways. If the ticket is cancelled within four hours of the journey, then the passenger will get a full refund.</p>

<h2>Can You Travel with a Tatkal Waiting List Ticket?</h2>

<p>No, you cannot travel with a Tatkal waiting list ticket. This is because the ticket is not confirmed and you will not be allowed to board the train until it is confirmed. Even if the ticket is confirmed at the last minute, the passenger will not be allowed to board the train if the number of passengers exceeds the limit. This is because the railway authorities need to ensure the safety of the passengers and they cannot allow overcrowding on the train.</p>

<h2>What Can You Do if You Have a Tatkal Waiting List Ticket?</h2>

<p>If you have a Tatkal waiting list ticket, then the best thing to do is to keep checking the status of the ticket. If the ticket is confirmed, then you can board the train. If the ticket is not confirmed, then you should cancel it and get a refund. You can also try to book a different train with more availability or opt for a different mode of travel.</p>
