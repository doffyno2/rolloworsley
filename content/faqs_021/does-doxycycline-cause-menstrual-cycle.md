It is important to note that this delay is not permanent and that the menstrual cycle should return to normal after the medication is stopped.</p>

<p>In addition to delaying the start of the menstrual cycle, doxycycline can also cause changes in the length of the menstrual cycle. Women may experience a shorter or longer menstrual cycle when taking doxycycline. In some cases, women may experience a lighter or heavier flow during their menstrual cycle.
