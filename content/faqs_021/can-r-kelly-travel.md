<p>R. Kelly, the American singer, songwriter, and record producer, has had a successful career spanning more than three decades. He has released countless hit singles, sold millions of albums, and earned an impressive net worth. As an international artist, he has also toured the world, performing in numerous countries. But, with his recent legal troubles, can R. Kelly still travel?</p>

<h2>R. Kelly's Legal Troubles and International Travel</h2>

<p>In February 2019, R. Kelly was arrested and charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in Illinois. Following the arrest, he was released on bail and placed on strict house arrest. As part of the conditions of his bail, R. Kelly was also prohibited from travelling outside of the United States. However, this ban has recently been lifted in order to allow the singer to travel for work purposes. </p>

<p>Although R. Kelly is now able to travel for work, there are still some restrictions on his movement. According to his lawyer, his travel within the US must be approved by the court. He must also provide the court with details of his planned trips, including destination, dates, and a list of the people he will be travelling with. </p>

<p>Furthermore, R. Kelly is still prohibited from travelling to countries that have extradition treaties with the US. This means that he is unable to visit Canada, the UK, Australia, and other countries where he may have fans and business opportunities. </p>

<h2>R. Kelly's Recent International Travel</h2>

<p>In August 2020, R. Kelly made his first international trip since his arrest in 2019. He travelled to Dubai on a business trip, where he was due to perform several concerts. However, the performances were cancelled after the Dubai government received reports of the singer's legal troubles in the US. As a result, the singer was forced to cut his trip short and return to the US.</p>

<p>Despite being banned from travelling to certain countries, R. Kelly has also been able to make trips to other nations. In November 2020, he travelled to Germany for a performance in Berlin. He was also reportedly in the Netherlands in January 2021, although the trip was not officially confirmed. </p>

<h2>R. Kelly's Future International Travel Plans</h2>

<p>Although R. Kelly is now able to travel internationally for work purposes, his legal troubles still pose a risk to his future plans. He is currently awaiting trial in the US, and if convicted, he could face a lengthy prison sentence. This would mean an end to his international travels for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Despite the risks, R. Kelly is still planning to travel overseas in the future. He has reportedly been in talks with promoters in Europe and Africa about possible performances in 2021. However, these plans are still in the early stages and it is not yet clear whether the singer will be able to make these trips.</p>

Kelly is still unable to travel to certain countries. He has recently been on trips to Dubai and Germany, and is currently in talks with promoters about possible performances in Europe and Africa in 2021.
