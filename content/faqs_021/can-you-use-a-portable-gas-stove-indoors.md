<p>Another risk associated with using a portable gas stove indoors is the risk of fire. Portable gas stoves are not designed to be used in enclosed spaces, and they can easily cause a fire if they are not used properly. Portable gas stoves should always be used on a stable, non-flammable surface, and they should never be left unattended while they are in use.</p>
