<p>Squid has been the subject of much speculation since he was sent to Camp Green Lake in the popular novel Holes. It is not known why Squid was sent to the juvenile detention center, but some believe it was due to his delinquent behavior. In the book, Squid was described as a troublemaker and a thief who had a tendency to pick fights with his peers. But why was he sent there?</p>

<p>There are several theories about why Squid got sent to Camp Green Lake. One possibility is that Squid was a victim of the 'Zero Tolerance' policy of the juvenile justice system. This policy was enacted in the late 1990s, and it states that juveniles who commit even minor offenses can be sent to juvenile detention centers. This means that if Squid was caught stealing or getting into fights with other children, he could have been sent to Camp Green Lake.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that Squid got sent to Camp Green Lake due to his involvement in gang-related activities. In the book, it is mentioned that Squid was a member of the group of juvenile delinquents known as the 'Eagles'. This gang was known to be involved in various criminal activities, such as drug dealing and theft. It is possible that Squid was sent to Camp Green Lake as a result of his involvement with the Eagles.</p>

<p>Finally, it is also possible that Squid was sent to Camp Green Lake as a result of his involvement in a fight. In the book, it is mentioned that Squid had a tendency to get into confrontations with other children. If Squid was involved in a fight that resulted in injury or property damage, he could have been sent to Camp Green Lake.</p>
