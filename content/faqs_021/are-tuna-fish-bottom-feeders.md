Tuna fish are one of the most popular seafood species in the world, and for good reason. They are a delicious, healthy, and economical food choice for people around the globe. But what many people donâ€™t realize is that tuna are also bottom feeders. This means they hunt for food at the bottom of the ocean, where they find a variety of crustaceans, mollusks, and other small creatures.

<h2>What Is Bottom Feeding?</h2>

Bottom feeding is a type of feeding behavior exhibited by some species of fish. Bottom feeders, such as tuna, will search the ocean floor for food and feed on whatever they find. This behavior is most often seen in species of fish that live in deeper, cooler waters.

<h2>Are Tuna Fish Endangered?</h2>

Unfortunately, some species of tuna fish are considered endangered. Overfishing and habitat destruction are two of the main threats to the survival of tuna fish. As a result, it is important to be aware of the impact that our actions may have on these species.
