<p>Do you ever feel like you’re burning more calories when you’re sick? If so, you’re not alone. Many people report feeling like they’re burning more calories when they’re sick, and it’s actually a very common feeling. But what do you really need to know about the calories burned when sick? Let’s take a closer look.</p>

<h2>Why Do You Burn More Calories When Sick?</h2>

<p>When you’re sick, your body is working hard to fight the infection. This means your body needs more energy, and thus you’re burning more calories as it works to fight the illness. Additionally, when you’re sick, you may also be burning more calories due to a fever. Fevers can cause your body to burn extra calories as it works to cool down. Finally, if you’re coughing or sneezing a lot when you’re sick, you may also be burning more calories due to the extra energy that activity requires.</p>

<h2>How Many Calories Are Burned When Sick?</h2>

<p>The exact number of calories you’ll burn when you’re sick depends on a variety of factors, including your overall health, the type of illness you have, and the severity of the illness.

<h2>Should You Try To Increase The Number Of Calories Burned When Sick?</h2>

<p>It’s important to note that while you may burn more calories when you’re sick, it’s not always a good idea to try to increase that number. Your body needs energy to fight off the illness, and if you’re already burning more calories than you normally would, then it’s best to focus on getting enough rest and eating a healthy diet. Trying to increase the number of calories burned when sick could actually put your body under too much strain, which could make it even harder for your body to fight the illness.</p>

<h2>Can Exercise Help To Increase The Number Of Calories Burned When Sick?</h2>
