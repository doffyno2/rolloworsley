<p>Tents are a great way to stay out of the elements when you’re out camping in the wild. But when you’re in a car, you need a different kind of shelter and protection. That’s where car tents come in. Car tents are specially designed for use in a car, and they provide the same kind of protection from the elements as a standard tent, but with an added layer of security. In this guide, we’ll show you how to put on a Dayz codelock car tent, so you can keep your car safe and secure while you’re out and about.</p>

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

<p>To install a car tent, you'll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Dayz codelock car tent</li>
  <li>A drill and drill bits</li>
  <li>Screws</li>
  <li>A hammer</li>
  <li>A screwdriver</li>
  <li>A level</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Car</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you'll need to make sure the car is ready for the installation. First, make sure the car is parked in a level spot. If the car is not level, you may need to use a level to make sure it is. Then, make sure the area around the car is clear. You'll need enough room to work and to move around, so move any obstacles out of the way.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Assemble the Tent</h2>

<p>Once the car is ready, you can start assembling the tent. Place the tent in the area you want to install it. You may need to use a level to make sure it is level. Once it is level, attach the poles to the tent using the provided screws. Make sure the poles are securely attached.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Secure the Tent to the Car</h2>

<p>Once the tent is assembled, you'll need to secure it to the car. Start by drilling holes in the car. You'll need to make sure the holes are in the right place, so use a level to make sure they are. Once the holes are drilled, insert the screws into the holes and secure the tent to the car. You may need to use a hammer to make sure the screws are securely in place.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Install the Dayz Codelock</h2>

<p>The final step is to install the Dayz codelock. To do this, you'll need to attach the codelock to the tent. Use the provided screws and a screwdriver to secure the codelock to the tent. Once the codelock is securely in place, you can set the code and lock the tent.</p>
