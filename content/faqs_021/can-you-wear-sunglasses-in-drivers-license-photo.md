Can You Wear Sunglasses in Drivers License Photo?

When applying for a driver’s license, applicants are often asked to provide a photo as part of the application process. This photo serves as an official record of the driver’s identity and is used to verify the information included on the license. While most states have specific regulations regarding what is required to be included in the photo, there are some states that allow drivers to wear sunglasses in the photo.



Most states require that the driver’s license photo must be a clear and recognizable image of the applicant’s face. The photo should include the head and shoulders of the driver, with no other people or objects visible in the photo. In some cases, hats and other headgear may be allowed, but usually only if they are worn for religious reasons. The photo should provide a recognizable and accurate representation of the driver’s physical appearance.



The answer to this question varies by state. Some states allow drivers to wear sunglasses in the driver’s license photo, while others do not. In states where sunglasses are allowed, they must be a light color and should not cover any part of the face. The sunglasses should also be non-reflective. If a driver is wearing sunglasses in the photo, the driver’s eyes should be visible.



The following states allow drivers to wear sunglasses in their driver’s license photos: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.



If a driver wears sunglasses in a driver’s license photo, it is important to ensure that the photo is still a clear and accurate representation of the driver’s physical appearance. If the sunglasses are too dark or cover too much of the face, the photo may not be accepted. Additionally, if the driver wears glasses for medical reasons, such as to correct vision, the glasses should be worn in the photo.
