It is a common misconception that pet products are interchangeable and can be used on any type of animal.

Cat shampoos are typically more alkaline, which helps balance their naturally acidic pH level. Additionally, cat shampoos are often formulated to be gentler than dog shampoos and may contain ingredients that are beneficial for cats, such as tea tree oil or oatmeal.
