Madden 16 is the latest release of the long-running and popular Madden NFL video game series. It offers a range of new features and improvements over previous versions, including the ability to fake hike in the game. Fake hiking is a technique used by quarterbacks to try and confuse opposing defenses and gain an advantage on the field. However, this technique can be difficult to master and can take a lot of practice to get right. In this article, we'll take a look at how to fake hike in Madden 16, so you can use this powerful technique to your advantage.

<h2>What Is Fake Hiking?</h2>

Fake hiking is a technique used by quarterbacks to try and confuse opposing defenses. It involves the quarterback making a fake motion with the ball, which looks like they are about to hike it, but then changing their mind at the last minute and keeping the ball in their hands. The aim is to make the defense think the ball has been hiked and to give the quarterback more time to find an open receiver or to run the ball themselves.

<h2>How To Fake Hike In Madden 16</h2>

Fake hiking in Madden 16 can be a tricky skill to master, but with some practice, it can be a great way to give yourself more time on the field and to confuse the opposition. Here's how to do it:

<h3>Step 1: Line Up In The Pocket</h3>

The first step in fake hiking is to line up in the pocket as you normally would. This will give you the space you need to make the fake motion with the ball and to keep it in your hands.

<h3>Step 2: Make The Fake Motion</h3>

Once you're lined up in the pocket, you'll need to make the fake motion with the ball. This involves making a motion as if you were going to hike the ball, but then quickly pulling it back and keeping it in your hands. The key here is to make the motion as believable as possible, so that the defense is tricked into thinking you've hiked the ball.

<h3>Step 3: Keep The Ball In Your Hands</h3>

Once you've made the fake motion, it's important to keep the ball in your hands. This is because if you try to throw the ball, you'll be flagged for an illegal forward pass. Instead, you should keep the ball and look for an open receiver or run the ball yourself.

<h2>Tips For Fake Hiking in Madden 16</h2>

Fake hiking in Madden 16 is a great way to give yourself some extra time on the field and to confuse the opposition. However, it can take a bit of practice to get the technique right. Here are some tips to help you master fake hiking:

<h3>1. Practice Regularly</h3>

<h3>2. Watch The Pros</h3>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

Fake hiking in Madden 16 can be a great way to give yourself an advantage on the field and to confuse the defense. However, it can take a bit of practice to master the technique.
