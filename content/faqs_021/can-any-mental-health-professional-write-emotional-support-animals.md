In this article, we’ll discuss who can write an ESA letter and the general requirements for obtaining one. We’ll also look at what an ESA letter is and how it can help those who need emotional and psychological support.

<h2>What Is an ESA Letter?</h2>

An emotional support animal (ESA) letter is a document issued by a mental health professional that officially recognizes an animal as an emotional support animal. This document verifies the individual’s need for an emotional support animal to provide necessary emotional and psychological support.

The ESA letter is a legal document that must be provided to landlords, airlines, and other entities who require proof of an individual’s need for an emotional support animal. The letter confirms that the individual has a mental health condition, such as depression, anxiety, or PTSD, and requires the animal’s companionship and emotional support in order to function in daily life.

<h2>Who Can Write an ESA Letter?</h2>

The ESA letter must be written by a mental health professional, such as a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist. The mental health professional must be licensed in the state in which they are practicing.

The mental health professional must also have an established relationship with the individual in need of an emotional support animal. This means that the mental health professional must have seen the individual for an established period of time and been able to properly assess the individual’s mental health condition.
