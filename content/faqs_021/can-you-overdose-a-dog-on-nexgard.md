<p>NexGard is an oral flea and tick preventive medication for dogs. It’s a beef-flavored chewable tablet that works to kill fleas and ticks quickly and effectively. It’s a popular medication among pet owners, as it’s fast-acting and easy to give to your dog. But is it safe? Can you overdose a dog on NexGard?</p>

<p>The active ingredient in NexGard is afoxolaner, an insecticide that acts on the nervous system of fleas and ticks. This means it can be toxic if too much is ingested by a dog. That’s why it’s important to make sure you follow the instructions on the package when giving your dog NexGard.</p>

<h2>How Much NexGard Is Too Much?</h2>

<p>The recommended dosage of NexGard for dogs is one chewable tablet per month, per the weight of the dog. This means that a 10-pound dog should receive one chewable tablet, while a 70-pound dog should receive seven chewable tablets. It’s important to make sure that you are giving your dog the correct dosage of NexGard, as too much can lead to serious adverse effects.</p>

<p>If a dog is accidentally given more than the recommended dosage of NexGard, it’s important to seek immediate veterinary attention. Overdosing on NexGard can cause serious adverse effects, including vomiting, diarrhea, decreased appetite, seizures, and even death.</p>

<h2>What Should You Do if Your Dog Overdoses on NexGard?</h2>

<p>If you suspect that your dog has overdosed on NexGard, it’s important to seek immediate veterinary attention. It’s also important to bring the bottle of NexGard with you to the vet, as they will need to know the exact amount of medication that was ingested. The vet will be able to assess the situation and determine the best course of action.</p>

<p>In some cases, the vet may recommend inducing vomiting in order to reduce the amount of medication that has been ingested. This should only be done under the supervision of a veterinarian. In more serious cases, the vet may need to administer medication to reduce the adverse effects of the overdose. In extreme cases, hospitalization may be necessary.</p>

<h2>How to Prevent an Overdose of NexGard</h2>

<p>The best way to prevent an overdose of NexGard is to make sure you are giving your dog the correct dosage. Always read the instructions on the package and follow them carefully. If you are unsure about the correct dosage, consult your veterinarian.</p>

<p>It’s also important to store NexGard in a safe place, out of reach of children and pets. Accidental ingestion is a common cause of NexGard overdoses, so it’s important to make sure the medication is not accessible to anyone who should not be taking it.</p>
