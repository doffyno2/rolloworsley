<p>Fish are vertebrates, meaning they have bones. But are there other species of fish that are boneless? The answer is yes, there are fish without bones. In fact, there are several different types of boneless fish that can be found in both fresh and salt water.</p>

<h2>Types of Boneless Fish</h2>

<p>The most common type of boneless fish is the jellyfish. Jellyfish are found in both salt and fresh water, and are characterized by their translucent bodies and long, thin tentacles. Jellyfish do not possess a skeletal system and instead rely on their tentacles to move through the water. Other boneless fish include sea cucumbers and hagfish, which are both found in the deep ocean. Sea cucumbers are elongated and resemble worms, while hagfish are eel-like and can reach up to 3 meters in length.</p>

<h2>Adaptations of Boneless Fish</h2>

<p>Boneless fish have some unique adaptations that enable them to survive in the ocean. For example, jellyfish use their tentacles to catch prey and to move through the water. Sea cucumbers are able to use their bodies to burrow into the ocean floor, while hagfish are able to secrete a slimy substance that allows them to escape from predators. These adaptations enable boneless fish to thrive in their environment.</p>

<h2>Are Boneless Fish Edible?</h2>

<p>Although boneless fish are not as popular as traditional fish, some people do eat them. Jellyfish is a popular dish in some Asian countries, while hagfish and sea cucumbers are often consumed in some areas of Europe. Although these are not considered to be gourmet foods, some people do enjoy them as a delicacy.</p>

<h2>Are Boneless Fish Endangered?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, boneless fish are at risk of becoming endangered due to overfishing and pollution. Jellyfish populations have been declining due to overfishing, while sea cucumbers and hagfish are also at risk due to pollution. It is important to take steps to protect these species, so that they can continue to exist in the wild.</p>
