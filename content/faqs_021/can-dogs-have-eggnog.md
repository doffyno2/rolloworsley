<p>Eggnog is a popular holiday beverage enjoyed by many people during the Christmas season. It is usually made with milk, cream, sugar, and spices, and sometimes includes a splash of alcohol. But can dogs have eggnog too?</p>

<p>The answer is no. Eggnog is not safe for dogs to drink. Dairy products are not easily digested by dogs and can cause digestive issues like vomiting, diarrhea, and upset stomach. The sugar in eggnog can also lead to weight gain, diabetes, and other health problems for your pup. The same goes for alcoholic eggnog — alcohol is toxic to dogs and can even be fatal.</p>

<p>However, there are some ways you can make a dog-friendly version of eggnog. To begin, you should replace the milk and cream with lactose-free milk or plain yogurt. You can also use a sugar-free eggnog recipe. If the eggnog recipe calls for alcohol, you should omit it altogether or substitute it with a non-alcoholic version. An alternative to eggnog is to make a dog-friendly smoothie with lactose-free milk and fresh fruits like apples, bananas, or blueberries. This is a great way to give your pup a special treat during the holidays.</p>
