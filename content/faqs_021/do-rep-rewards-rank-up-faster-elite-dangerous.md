<p>Elite Dangerous is a space trading and combat simulator that allows players to explore a realistic 1:1 scale Milky Way galaxy. Players take on the role of a commander and travel through space, trading goods, completing missions and engaging in combat with other players and AI-controlled enemies. One of the most beloved aspects of the game is the progression system, where players unlock new ships, weapons, and other rewards for completing various tasks.</p>

<p>One of the most popular rewards players can receive is reputation points, or Rep, from completing various missions. These Rep points can be used to purchase special rewards from various factions, such as ships and weapons. But how do Rep rewards rank up faster in Elite Dangerous?</p>

<h2>How Does Rep Ranking Work?</h2>

<p>Each mission in Elite Dangerous has a reputation score attached to it. This score is based on how difficult the mission is, how dangerous the enemies are, and the rewards players can receive for completing it. The higher the reputation score, the more Rep points players will receive upon completion.</p>

<p>These Rep points are then used to rank up with a faction. Different factions have different rank systems, but they all reward players with better rewards the higher they rank. For example, players who reach the highest rank in a faction may receive a unique ship or weapon, or even access to a secret mission.</p>

<p>Players can increase their reputation with a faction by completing missions and tasks associated with that faction. The more Rep points they accumulate, the faster they will rank up with that faction.</p>
