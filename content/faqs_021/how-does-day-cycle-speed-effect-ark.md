The day cycle speed of ARK: Survival Evolved affects the speed at which the game progresses. This can have a significant effect on how quickly your character can progress through the game, as well as the difficulty of some of the challenges. In this article, we will take a look at how the day cycle speed affects ARK and how to adjust it to your advantage.

<h2>What Is the Day Cycle Speed in ARK?</h2>

The day cycle speed in ARK: Survival Evolved is the amount of time it takes for the day/night cycle to pass. This cycle affects many aspects of the game, including the rate at which your character levels up, the speed at which resources respawn, and the difficulty of some of the creatures you encounter. 

The default day cycle speed in ARK is set to 1. This means that a full day/night cycle will take 24 minutes of real-time to pass. This is the recommended setting for most players, as it provides a reasonable balance between the speed of gameplay and the difficulty of the challenges.

<h2>Can You Change the Day Cycle Speed?</h2>

Yes, you can change the day cycle speed in ARK: Survival Evolved. The easiest way to do this is to open the console in-game and type in “set daycyclespeed” followed by the desired speed. For example, if you wanted to increase the day cycle speed to 2, you would type in “set daycyclespeed 2”.

If you are playing on an official server, you may not have the ability to change the day cycle speed, as this is usually set by the server administrator.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Increasing the Day Cycle Speed?</h2>

Increasing the day cycle speed in ARK: Survival Evolved can provide a number of benefits to players. The most obvious benefit is that it will reduce the amount of time it takes for your character to level up. This can be especially useful for players who are trying to reach higher levels quickly. 

Additionally, increasing the day cycle speed can also make some of the creatures in ARK easier to defeat. This is because the creatures’ spawn rate is based on the day cycle, so increasing the speed of the cycle will result in fewer creatures spawning. This can make it easier to progress through the game without having to fight large numbers of creatures.

<h2>What Are the Disadvantages of Increasing the Day Cycle Speed?</h2>

Increasing the day cycle speed in ARK: Survival Evolved can also have some drawbacks. One of the most obvious drawbacks is that it can make the game feel rushed. If you increase the day cycle speed too much, you may find that you don’t have enough time to explore the map or complete all of the tasks before the day/night cycle ends. 

Additionally, increasing the day cycle speed can also make some of the creatures in ARK more difficult to defeat. This is because the creatures’ spawn rate is based on the day cycle, so increasing the speed of the cycle will result in more creatures spawning. This can make it harder to progress through the game if you are constantly having to fight large numbers of creatures.

<h2>How to Adjust the Day Cycle Speed for Your Playstyle</h2>

If you want to adjust the day cycle speed in ARK: Survival Evolved for your playstyle, there are a few things you can do. First, you should experiment with different day cycle speeds to see which one works best for you. If you find that the default speed is too slow, try increasing it slightly. Conversely, if you find that the default speed is too fast, try decreasing it slightly. 

You should also consider the difficulty of the creatures in the game when adjusting the day cycle speed. If you find that the creatures are too easy to defeat, try increasing the day cycle speed. Conversely, if you find that the creatures are too difficult to defeat, try decreasing the day cycle speed.
