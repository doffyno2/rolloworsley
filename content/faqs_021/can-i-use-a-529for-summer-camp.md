<h2>What Is a 529 Plan?</h2>

A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan that is designed to help people save for college. It is sponsored by a state or educational institution, and the funds in the plan can be used to pay for college expenses. It is named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, which created the plans. 

529 plans are often called "qualified tuition plans" or "QTPs," and they are a popular way for parents to save for their children's future college expenses. The funds in a 529 plan grow tax-free, and the money can be used to pay for tuition, room and board, mandatory fees, books, and other qualified educational expenses. 

<h2>Are Summer Camps Eligible Expenses?</h2>

The short answer is yes, summer camps can be eligible expenses with a 529 plan. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers summer camps to be qualified expenses if they are related to the development of "enrolled students' academic, athletic, or other abilities." 

However, there are some restrictions. Summer camps must meet certain criteria to be considered qualified expenses. They must be accredited or supervised by a school, a religious organization, or a government agency. The camp must provide educational or skill-building activities that are related to the students' academic, athletic, or other abilities. 

<h2>What Types of Summer Camps Can I Pay For With a 529 Plan?</h2>

<h2>Are There Any Drawbacks to Using a 529 Plan?</h2>
