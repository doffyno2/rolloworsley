<p>Having your car windows or windshield damaged can be a major hassle. It can be expensive and time-consuming to have it repaired, and if you don't have the right type of insurance coverage, you may be stuck with the entire bill. Fortunately, Geico auto insurance offers coverage for glass repair. Here's what you need to know about Geico's coverage and how to make sure you're properly protected.</p>

<h2>What Does Geico Insurance Cover?</h2>

<p>Geico auto insurance provides comprehensive coverage that includes glass repair and replacement. This coverage is included with all Geico policies, so you don't need to purchase additional coverage to be covered. The coverage applies to all types of glass, including windshields and windows, as well as sunroofs and moon roofs. Geico may also cover the cost of towing and labor associated with glass repair and replacement.</p>

<p>In most cases, Geico will cover the cost of the repair or replacement up to the policy limit. The exact amount of coverage you receive will depend on the type of policy you have and the amount of coverage you purchase. The policy limit is the maximum amount that Geico will pay for the repair or replacement. You are responsible for any costs that exceed this limit.</p>

<h2>How Much Does Geico Insurance Cost?</h2>
