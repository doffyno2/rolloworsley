<p>Vrbo, formerly known as Vacation Rentals by Owner, is an online platform that connects property owners and travelers around the world. It was founded in 1995 and has grown to be one of the largest vacation rental platforms in the world. Vrbo offers travelers the opportunity to book vacation homes, condos, villas, cabins, and more in over 190 countries worldwide.</p>

<p>Vrbo has become a popular choice for travelers in recent years, with more people now opting to rent vacation homes instead of paying for hotel rooms. Not only is it more cost-effective, it also offers more space and privacy for those who prefer to stay in a home away from home. But for those who are looking for a more traditional travel experience, Vrbo also offers the option to book through travel agents.</p>

<h2>How Does Vrbo Work With Travel Agents?</h2>

<p>Vrbo works with travel agents in two ways. First, it allows travelers to book directly through a travel agent. This can be done either online or by phone. The travel agent will then take care of all the details of the booking, from searching for the right property to confirming the reservation. The travel agent will also be able to provide advice on the best places to stay and attractions to visit.</p>

<p>The second way Vrbo works with travel agents is through its affiliate program. This allows travel agents to earn a commission for each booking they make through Vrbo. The commission rate varies by country, but it is usually around 10%. This money can be used to cover the cost of marketing, advertising, and other expenses associated with running a travel agency.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Working With a Travel Agent When Booking With Vrbo</h2>

<p>Booking through a travel agent has several benefits for those who are looking to rent a vacation home through Vrbo. For one, the travel agent will be able to provide detailed advice on the best properties to rent and activities to enjoy during the stay. They will also be able to provide additional services, such as helping to plan transportation to and from the destination, arranging for car rentals, and arranging for any additional services that might be needed during the stay.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the travel agent will be able to provide a personal touch and help to ensure that the booking runs smoothly. They will be able to answer any questions the traveler might have and provide additional assistance if needed. Finally, the travel agent will be able to provide a more personalized service than what is offered by Vrbo directly.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Drawbacks of Working With a Travel Agent When Booking With Vrbo?</h2>

<p>The main drawback of booking through a travel agent when using Vrbo is the additional cost. Travel agents do charge a commission for their services, so it is important to factor this in when calculating the total cost of the stay. It is also important to note that some travel agents may not be able to provide the level of service that is offered directly through Vrbo.</p>

<h2>What Is the Best Way to Find a Travel Agent?</h2>

<p>The best way to find a travel agent that works with Vrbo is to search online. There are many websites and directories that list travel agents that specialize in vacation rentals. Additionally, many travel agents advertise their services on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram. It is important to do some research and compare the services and prices of different travel agents before making a decision.</p>
