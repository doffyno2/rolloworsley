Coneflowers are a type of echinacea, a genus of flowering plants native to North America. They are popular in gardens and flower beds, as they are easy to grow and have attractive flowers. The most common type of coneflower is Echinacea purpurea, which has purple petals and a yellow center.

Coneflowers can be beneficial for dogs in many ways. The flowers contain compounds that are believed to have anti-inflammatory and immune-boosting properties. This can help reduce inflammation in your dog's body, which can help with a variety of conditions, including arthritis and skin allergies.
