<p>Slicksters are known for their agility and remarkable acrobatic abilities. They are known to climb walls, leap tall buildings, and even run up vertical surfaces with ease. But how do they do it? Can any of us learn from their techniques and gain some of their powers?</p>

<p>In the world of parkour, slicksters are often seen as a breed apart.
