Dogs are known to be carnivores, and they have an instinctive craving for meat. Chicken wings are a popular source of protein for humans, but is it safe for dogs to eat cooked chicken wings? Let's take a closer look at the safety of cooked chicken wings for dogs.



Chicken wings are the flat pieces of meat that come from the chicken's wings. The wings are divided into three parts: the flat part, the drumstick, and the tip.

When preparing cooked chicken wings for your dog, it is important to ensure that the chicken is cooked thoroughly, as raw or undercooked chicken can contain bacteria that can be harmful to dogs.
