<p>Humans have been living with dogs since ancient times, and they have developed a strong bond of companionship and love. Dogs are very affectionate animals and enjoy spending time with their owners. Some owners have even gone to the extent of teaching their dogs to perform tricks and other activities. One of these activities is making your dog hump you. This activity is often seen as fun and entertaining by both the dog and the owner.</p>

<p>In order to make your dog hump you, you must first understand the way that dogs communicate with each other. They communicate through body language and physical contact. When two dogs are playing, they may start to hump each other as a way of showing their affection and dominance. When a dog is humping you, it is a sign that it is trying to establish dominance over you and wants to be the leader of the pack.</p>

<p>The first step in making your dog hump you is to establish dominance over it. This is done by making sure that you are the one in control of the situation.
