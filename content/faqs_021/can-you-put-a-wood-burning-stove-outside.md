While wood burning stoves are a popular choice for indoor heating, some homeowners may be wondering if they can install a wood burning stove outdoors. The short answer is that it is possible to install a wood burning stove outside, but there are important safety considerations that must be taken into account before doing so. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of outdoor wood burning stoves, as well as the safety considerations and best practices for installing one. 

<h2>Pros and Cons of Outdoor Wood Burning Stoves</h2>

There are a few advantages to installing a wood burning stove outdoors, such as the lack of need for venting, reduced fire hazard, and more aesthetically pleasing appearance. However, there are also some downsides to outdoor wood burning stoves, such as difficulty in lighting, greater risk of theft and vandalism, and the need for extra protection from the elements. 

<h3>Venting</h3>

One of the main advantages of installing an outdoor wood burning stove is that it does not require any venting. This is because the stove is located outside and is exposed to the open air, which allows the smoke and other emissions to dissipate naturally. This eliminates the need for expensive and complex venting systems, which can be a major cost savings when installing a wood burning stove indoors. 

<h3>Fire Hazard Reduction</h3>

Another advantage of installing an outdoor wood burning stove is that it reduces the risk of a house fire. This is because there is no need to worry about the smoke and other emissions from the stove building up in the home and potentially causing a fire. As long as the stove is installed correctly, with proper clearances and safety measures in place, the risk of a house fire is significantly reduced. 

<h3>Aesthetically Pleasing Appearance</h3>

Outdoor wood burning stoves can also add an aesthetically pleasing element to your outdoor living space. As long as the stove is installed correctly and in a safe manner, it can be a great addition to your outdoor living space. 

<h3>Difficulty in Lighting</h3>

One of the main drawbacks of outdoor wood burning stoves is the difficulty in lighting them. This is because the stoves are exposed to the elements, which can make it difficult to light the fire and keep it going in windy or wet conditions. 

<h3>Greater Risk of Theft and Vandalism</h3>

Another downside to installing an outdoor wood burning stove is the greater risk of theft and vandalism. Because the stove is located outside, it is more exposed to potential criminals and can be an easy target for theft or vandalism. 

<h3>Need for Extra Protection from the Elements</h3>

Finally, installing an outdoor wood burning stove requires extra protection from the elements. This includes making sure that the stove is installed in a sheltered location, such as under a canopy or other protective covering. It is also important to make sure that the stove is installed on a level surface, as this will help to prevent the stove from tipping over in high winds or other weather events.
