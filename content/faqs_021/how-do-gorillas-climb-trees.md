<h2>How Do Gorillas Climb Trees?</h2>

<p>Gorillas are able to climb trees because of their strong arms, fingers, and legs. Gorillas use their arms to grab onto branches and hold on while they pull themselves up. Then they use their fingers, legs, and feet to grip onto the branches and pull themselves higher. Their legs and feet are very powerful, and they are able to hold onto the branches even if they are slippery or wet. Gorillas also use their long tails as a balance and a tool to help them climb. They twist it around branches to give themselves extra support.</p>

<p>Gorillas climb trees for a variety of reasons. One of the most common reasons is to find food.

The western lowland gorilla and the eastern lowland gorilla are both able to climb trees, although they do so less often than other species. Gorillas of all ages can climb trees, but it is most common among younger gorillas, who use trees as a way to explore their environment.</p>

<h2>Do Gorillas Live in Trees?</h2>
