<p>When it comes to providing our beloved four-legged friends with treats, it’s important to make sure that they are safe and healthy. Many dog owners enjoy giving their canine companions chew treats, which can provide hours of entertainment as well as valuable nutrition. Unfortunately, some of these treats are made in China, which can cause concern for pet parents who want to ensure the safety of their pooch. But are dog chews from China safe?</p>

<p>The simple answer is yes, dog chews from China can be safe – however, you should still take precautions before giving them to your pup. Most chew treats are made of either rawhide, made from animal skin, or compressed rawhide, which is a combination of rawhide and starch. While rawhide could be made from hides sourced from anywhere in the world, compressed rawhide is most often sourced from China. It is important to note that the ingredients and manufacturing processes used to make these chews are heavily regulated and monitored, so you can feel confident in the safety of your pup’s snack.</p>

<h2>How to Tell if Dog Chews from China are Safe</h2>

<p>The first step in making sure that your pup’s treat is safe is to check the packaging. Look for a label that states that the product is made in China, as this is a good indication that it is safe. Additionally, look for any signs of wear and tear on the product, such as tears in the packaging, which could indicate that the product is not as fresh as it should be. Finally, make sure to read the ingredients list on the packaging, as this will tell you what is actually inside the treat.</p>

<p>In addition to checking the packaging, you should also look for certain certifications on the product. The American Pet Products Association (APPA) and the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) both provide certifications for pet food and treats, so look for their seals on the product. Additionally, you should check for certifications from the Chinese Quality Food Safety (CQFS) or the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA). These certifications mean that the product has been tested for safety and quality, so you can be sure that it is safe for your pup.</p>

<h2>What to Avoid When Buying Dog Chews from China</h2>

<p>While most dog chews from China are safe, there are some things that you should look out for. The first is that you should avoid treats that are made with artificial ingredients, as they can be harmful to your pup’s health. Additionally, you should avoid treats that contain chemical preservatives, as these can be toxic. Finally, you should avoid any chews that are made with low-quality ingredients, as these can cause digestive issues in your pup.</p>

<h2>Are Dog Chews from China Safe? The Bottom Line</h2>
