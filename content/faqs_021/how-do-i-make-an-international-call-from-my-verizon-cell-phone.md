<p>Making an international call from your Verizon cell phone is a relatively simple process, but there are a few things you need to know before you begin. This article will provide step-by-step instructions on how to make an international call from your Verizon cell phone, as well as some important information about international calling from Verizon.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions for Making an International Call from Your Verizon Cell Phone</h2>

<p>The first step in making an international call from your Verizon cell phone is to dial the international access code for the country you are calling. This is usually either “00” or “+”, followed by the country code of the country you are calling. For example, if you are calling the United Kingdom, you would dial “00 44”. You can find a full list of country codes here.</p>

<p>Once you have dialed the international access code and the country code, you will then need to dial the phone number you are calling, including the area code if applicable. If you are calling a mobile number, you may need to add a “1” before the phone number. For example, if you are calling a mobile number in the United Kingdom, you would dial “00 44 1 123 456 7890”.</p>

<p>Once you have dialed the full phone number, you will then need to wait for the call to connect. The call may take a few seconds to connect, depending on the country you are calling and the quality of your connection. Once the call is connected, you can begin speaking.</p>
