TSA Pre✓® is a pre-screening program for air travelers that allows them to enjoy a more secure and efficient security screening process when traveling. The program allows approved travelers to pass through a dedicated security lane with no need to remove shoes, laptops, liquids, belts, and light jackets. In order to ensure the highest levels of security, the TSA requires that authorized travelers re-enroll in the program every five years. Understanding when your TSA Pre✓® expiration date is approaching is important in order to ensure that you are always able to take advantage of the program.

<h2>What is the TSA PreCheck Program?</h2>

TSA Pre✓® is a program developed by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) that allows travelers who have been pre-screened to enjoy a more efficient security screening process when traveling. The program allows approved travelers to pass through a dedicated security lane with no need to remove shoes, laptops, liquids, belts, and light jackets. To be approved for TSA Pre✓®, travelers must pass a background check and provide their personal information to the TSA. 

<h2>How Do I Enroll in TSA PreCheck?</h2>

Enrolling in TSA Pre✓® is a straightforward process. Applicants can enroll in the program by visiting an enrollment center, completing an online application, and paying an application fee. The process typically takes less than 10 minutes and requires applicants to provide biographic information, such as name, date of birth, address, and Social Security number. Once a traveler has been approved for the program, they will receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN) which will allow them to use the TSA Pre✓® lane when flying. 

<h2>How Long Does TSA PreCheck Last?</h2>

Once you have been approved for TSA Pre✓®, you will be able to use the dedicated security lanes for five years. After the five-year period has elapsed, you will need to re-enroll in the program in order to continue using the TSA Pre✓® lanes. 

<h2>How Do I Know When My TSA PreCheck Expires?</h2>

There are several ways to find out when your TSA Pre✓® expiration date is approaching. The easiest way to find out when your enrollment period ends is to check your Known Traveler Number (KTN). Your KTN can be found on your boarding pass or on your account with the airline you are flying with. The KTN will include your name and the date that your enrollment period expires. 

<h2>What If I Forget to Re-Enroll in TSA PreCheck?</h2>

If you forget to re-enroll in the TSA Pre✓® program before your enrollment period ends, you will no longer be able to use the dedicated security lanes. You will be required to go through the standard security screening process, which could take longer. In order to avoid any delays, it is important to make sure that you re-enroll in the program before your enrollment period ends.
