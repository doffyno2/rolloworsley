<p>Don’t Starve Together (DST) is a multiplayer survival game developed by Klei Entertainment. It is the sequel to Don’t Starve, with the same concept of surviving in the wilderness by gathering resources, crafting items and fighting off monsters. In Don’t Starve Together, you can team up with friends and strangers to explore the wilderness, build structures and craft items. One of the main mechanics of the game is the backpack. The backpack allows you to store items and carry them with you as you explore the world. But there are some items that cannot be put in the backpack.</p>
