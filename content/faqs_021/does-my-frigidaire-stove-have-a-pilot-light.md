<p>If you’ve recently purchased a Frigidaire stove, you may be wondering if your model has a pilot light. The answer is yes, most Frigidaire stoves come with a pilot light that provides a continuous flame to ignite the stove’s burners. But there are some exceptions, so it’s important to check your model’s specifications before you begin using your stove.</p>

<h2>What is a Pilot Light?</h2>

<p>A pilot light is a small flame that is constantly burning inside the stove. It serves as a ignition source for the stove’s burners, so that when you turn on a burner, the flame ignites from the pilot light. Without a pilot light, you would have to use a match or lighter to manually ignite the burners each time you wanted to use your stove.</p>

<h2>How to Locate the Pilot Light on a Frigidaire Stove</h2>

Once you’ve located it, use a match or lighter to ignite it. If the pilot light does not ignite, try adjusting the flame so that it is slightly larger. Once the pilot light is lit, you should be able to turn on the burner and the flame should ignite automatically.</p>
