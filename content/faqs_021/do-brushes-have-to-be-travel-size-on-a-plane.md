<p>Travelling by air is one of the most convenient and efficient forms of transportation. However, due to the strict regulations of airlines, it is important to know what items you can and cannot bring on board with you. This is especially true when it comes to cosmetics, as certain sizes of product are allowed and others are not. So, do brushes have to be travel size on a plane?</p>

<p>The answer is both yes and no. Each airline has their own regulations regarding the size of cosmetics you can bring on board with you. In general, most airlines allow you to bring on board a small travel-sized brush or two. The size of the brush must be within the allowed limits, which is usually around three to four inches in length. Some airlines may have different regulations, so it is important to check with the airline you are travelling with prior to your flight.</p>

<p>In addition to the size of the brush, it is also important to consider the type of brush you are bringing. Brushes that are made with natural materials, such as boar bristles, are generally allowed on board as they are not considered hazardous materials. Brushes that are made with synthetic materials, such as plastic, are not allowed on board as they are considered hazardous materials. Therefore, it is important to double check the material of the brush before bringing it on board with you.</p>

<p>It is also important to check with your airline regarding any other restrictions they may have regarding the size of cosmetics you can bring on board. Some airlines may restrict the size of certain items, such as nail clippers, nail files, and scissors.
