Possums are mammals native to Australia and New Zealand, and they have a wide range of behaviors and physical characteristics that can make them difficult to manage. One of the most common questions people have about possums is whether or not they can climb wooden fences. 

The answer is yes, possums can climb wooden fences, although the type of fence and the age and size of the possum will determine how easily they can do so. In this article, we will explore how possums climb wooden fences, why they do it, and how to make your fence possum-proof.

<h2>How Do Possums Climb Wooden Fences?</h2>

Possums are very good climbers, and they can use their sharp claws to climb even relatively smooth surfaces, such as wooden fences. Possums have a strong grip and can easily climb up the posts and rails of wooden fences.

In some cases, possums may be able to climb the entire height of a wooden fence. This is most likely to occur when the fence is partially damaged or when the possum is young and more agile. 

<h2>Why Do Possums Climb Wooden Fences?</h2>

Possums are naturally curious animals and will often explore their surroundings. They are also very territorial and may climb a fence in order to establish a territory or to access a food source. 

In some cases, possums may be scared or stressed and will climb a fence in order to escape from a perceived threat. This could be a predator or a human presence. 

<h2>How Can You Make Your Fence Possum-Proof?</h2>

There are a number of ways to make your fence possum-proof, including:

<h3>1. Install a Mesh Fence</h3>

Installing a mesh fence is one of the most effective ways to prevent possums from climbing your fence. The mesh should be made from a heavy-duty galvanized material and should be at least three feet high. The mesh should also be attached to the fence posts with heavy-duty staples or screws.

<h3>2. Install an Electric Fence</h3>

An electric fence can be an effective deterrent for possums. The electric fence should be at least three feet high and should be installed in a way that prevents the possums from getting around or over it. The electric fence should be checked regularly for any signs of damage or wear and tear.

<h3>3. Trim Trees and Shrubs</h3>

Possums can use trees and shrubs as a way to access your fence, so it is important to trim them regularly. This will make it harder for possums to climb the fence and will also make it easier to spot any signs of possum activity.

<h3>4. Install Lights</h3>

Installing lights around your fence can be an effective way to deter possums. Possums are nocturnal animals and will usually avoid areas that are brightly lit.

<h3>5. Use Repellents</h3>

Repellents such as ammonia, mothballs, and garlic can be used to deter possums from climbing your fence. These repellents should be applied directly to the fence or around the perimeter of the property, and should be checked regularly for any signs of wear and tear.
