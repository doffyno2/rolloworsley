Raccoons have been known to cause a great deal of damage to both residential and commercial properties. As they are wild animals, it is important to be aware of their habits and behaviors in order to protect your property from damage. One question many property owners have is whether or not raccoons can climb stucco. The answer is yes, raccoons can climb stucco, and this can lead to serious damage and problems for property owners.

<h2>Why Do Raccoons Climb Stucco?</h2>

Raccoons climb stucco for a number of reasons. The most common reason is to gain access to food and shelter. Raccoons are omnivores, so they will eat just about anything they can get their hands on. If a raccoon finds a way into your home, they will look for food in your kitchen, pantry, and garbage cans.

Raccoons will also use stucco to gain access to shelter. Raccoons are nocturnal animals, so they will often seek shelter during the day in attics, garages, and other areas that are safe and dark. If they can find a way to climb stucco, they may be able to gain access to these areas and set up a den.

<h2>How Do Raccoons Climb Stucco?</h2>

Raccoons are excellent climbers and are capable of scaling just about any surface, including stucco. They have long claws and sharp teeth that allow them to grip onto surfaces and pull themselves up. Raccoons also have flexible bodies that allow them to climb up narrow spaces and squeeze into tight spots.

Raccoons will also use trees and other objects that are near the stucco to help them gain access. For example, if a tree is close to the stucco, a raccoon may use the tree to climb up to the stucco. Once the raccoon is on the stucco, they will use their claws and teeth to gain access to the building.

<h2>What Damage Can Raccoons Cause When Climbing Stucco?</h2>

Raccoons can cause a great deal of damage to your stucco when they climb it. Since raccoons have sharp claws and teeth, they can easily scratch and gouge the stucco. This can lead to serious damage and aesthetic problems.

In addition, raccoons can also cause structural damage to your home or building. If they are able to gain access to your attic or other areas, they can cause damage to insulation, wiring, and other areas.

<h2>How Can You Prevent Raccoons From Climbing Stucco?</h2>

There are a few steps you can take to prevent raccoons from climbing your stucco. The first is to make sure that all trees and objects near the stucco are trimmed or removed. This will make it more difficult for raccoons to gain access to the stucco.

You should also inspect your stucco for any cracks or openings that a raccoon may be able to use to gain access. If you find any, you should patch them up as soon as possible.

Finally, you should install a motion-activated light or sprinkler system near the stucco. This will startle raccoons and deter them from climbing it.
