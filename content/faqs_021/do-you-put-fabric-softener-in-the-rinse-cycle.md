<p>If you’ve ever thrown a load of laundry in the washing machine, you’ve probably asked yourself the question: “Do you put fabric softener in the rinse cycle?” The answer is: it depends on what type of fabric softener you’re using. There are both liquid and dryer sheet fabric softeners, and each one has different instructions for use.</p>

<h2>What is Fabric Softener?</h2>

<p>Fabric softener is a liquid or dryer sheet product designed to make clothes feel softer and reduce static cling. It works by coating clothes with a thin layer of oil, which keeps the fabric fibers from rubbing against each other and causing static electricity. It also helps reduce wrinkles and can make your clothes smell better.</p>

<h2>Liquid Fabric Softener</h2>

<p>Liquid fabric softener is typically added to the rinse cycle of a wash cycle, but some washers have a dedicated fabric softener dispenser. If your washer has a fabric softener dispenser, you can simply fill it up with fabric softener and the machine will automatically dispense it during the rinse cycle. If your washer doesn’t have a fabric softener dispenser, you can add the fabric softener to the rinse cycle manually.</p>

<h2>Dryer Sheet Fabric Softener</h2>

<p>Dryer sheet fabric softener is designed to be used in a tumble dryer. The dryer sheet is placed in the dryer along with the wet clothes and then heated up. As the heat circulates, the dryer sheet releases a thin layer of oil onto the clothes, which softens them and reduces static cling. Dryer sheet fabric softener should not be used in a washing machine.</p>

<h2>Do You Need to Use Fabric Softener?</h2>

<p>Whether or not you need to use fabric softener is a personal preference. If you like the feel and smell of soft, static-free clothes, then you may want to consider using fabric softener. However, if you don’t mind a little static cling or don’t mind the smell of your clothes, then you may be able to skip fabric softener altogether.</p>
