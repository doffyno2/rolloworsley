Does Milk Thistle Affect Your Menstrual Cycle?

What Is Milk Thistle?

Milk thistle is a plant from the Asteraceae family and is native to the Mediterranean region. It has a long history of use as a natural remedy for a variety of health problems, including liver and digestive issues. The active ingredient in milk thistle is silymarin, which is a group of flavonoids with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.

How Does Milk Thistle Affect The Menstrual Cycle?

Another study found that women who took a milk thistle supplement had a significant decrease in the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), a hormone that plays an important role in the menstrual cycle. This suggests that the supplement may have an effect on hormones related to the menstrual cycle.

In addition, some studies have found that milk thistle has a protective effect on the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. This may help to reduce the risk of endometriosis, a condition that can cause pelvic pain and infertility.

Finally, milk thistle has been found to have antioxidant properties, which can help to protect against cell damage caused by free radicals.
