<h2>What Are Tonsils?</h2>

<p>Tonsils are small, soft clusters of lymphatic tissue located at the back of the throat. In humans, they are located on either side of the throat just below the uvula. Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system and help to filter out bacteria and other pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose. </p>

<p>Tonsils also help to fight off infections. They contain white blood cells that can kill bacteria and other pathogens before they enter the body. When the body is infected, the tonsils become inflamed, which is known as tonsillitis. </p>

These tonsils are important for filtering out bacteria and other pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose.</p>
