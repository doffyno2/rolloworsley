<p>Fish is a great source of protein, and it's a popular addition to many diets. But if you buy too much fish, or if you have some leftovers, you may be wondering if you can freeze, thaw, and refreeze fish. The answer isn't always straightforward, so let's take a look at what you should know.</p>

<h2>What Is Freeze-Thaw-Refreeze?</h2>

<p>Freeze-thaw-refreeze is a process of freezing, thawing, and refreezing a food item. This process can be used to preserve food, since the cycle of freezing and thawing helps to keep bacteria from growing on the food item. However, some foods don't fare well when frozen, thawed, and refrozen. Fish is one of those foods.</p>

<h2>Can I Freeze Thaw and Refreeze Fish?</h2>

<p>The short answer is no, you should not freeze, thaw, and refreeze fish. Fish contains a lot of moisture, and when it's frozen, thawed, and refrozen, the moisture breaks down and the texture of the fish becomes mushy and unappetizing. Plus, refreezing fish can cause bacteria to grow, which can make you sick.</p>

<p>If you have frozen fish that you want to use, it's best to defrost it once and use it right away. If you don't plan to use it immediately, you can still freeze it, but don't thaw it before freezing it again.</p>

<h2>How Do I Thaw Frozen Fish?</h2>

This will give the fish enough time to thaw completely, and you can use it the next day. You can also thaw fish by submerging it in cold water. This method is faster than thawing in the refrigerator, but it requires more attention and you'll need to change the water every 30 minutes to ensure that the fish is thawing evenly.</p>
