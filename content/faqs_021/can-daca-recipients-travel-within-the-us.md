<p>Since its inception in 2012, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program has provided temporary protection from deportation for certain undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. One of the benefits of DACA is the ability to travel within the United States, allowing DACA recipients to visit family, pursue educational opportunities, and work in different states. However, there are some restrictions on travel for DACA recipients and it is important to understand the rules before attempting to travel.</p>

<h2>What is DACA?</h2>

<p>DACA is a program that was created by the Obama administration in 2012. The program protects certain undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children from deportation. To qualify for DACA, immigrants must meet certain criteria, including having arrived in the US before their 16th birthday and having lived in the US continuously since June 15, 2007. DACA also requires that immigrants have no criminal record and be enrolled in school or have a high school diploma. If approved, DACA recipients are eligible for a two-year period of deferred action from deportation and are eligible for work authorization.</p>

<h2>Can DACA Recipients Travel Within the US?</h2>

<p>Yes, DACA recipients are able to travel within the United States. However, they must apply for advance parole before they are able to travel. Advance parole is a document that is granted by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) that allows DACA recipients to leave the United States and return without affecting their DACA status or triggering removal proceedings. Advance parole is granted on a case-by-case basis and can be granted for a variety of reasons, including education, medical treatment, or travel for humanitarian reasons.</p>

<h2>What Is Required to Apply for Advance Parole?</h2>

<p>To apply for advance parole, DACA recipients must submit Form I-131, Application for Travel Document, to USCIS. The application must include a copy of the applicant’s valid passport, a copy of their DACA approval notice, and proof of the reason for travel, such as an invitation letter from a school or proof of a humanitarian purpose. The application fee is $575.</p>

<h2>What Happens After the Application Is Submitted?</h2>

<p>After the application is submitted, USCIS will review the application and make a decision. If the application is approved, USCIS will send the applicant an approval notice with instructions on how to obtain their travel document. Once the travel document is obtained, the DACA recipient is allowed to travel within the United States.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Restrictions on Travel for DACA Recipients?</h2>

<p>Yes, there are certain restrictions on travel for DACA recipients. DACA recipients are not permitted to travel outside of the United States without advance parole. Additionally, USCIS may deny an application for advance parole if the applicant has a criminal record or if the applicant’s travel is not deemed necessary or appropriate. DACA recipients should also be aware that travel outside of the United States, even with advance parole, may affect their DACA status or result in removal proceedings.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Advance Parole for DACA Recipients?</h2>

<p>Advance parole allows DACA recipients to travel within the United States without affecting their DACA status or triggering removal proceedings. This can open up new educational, work, and family opportunities that may not have been available before. Advance parole also allows DACA recipients to travel without fear of being stopped by immigration officials and subjected to deportation.</p>
