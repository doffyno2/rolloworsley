<p>Fishing cats have been a part of the American culture for centuries. They are popularly found in the wild, but there are also some people who keep them as pets. But the question is, are fishing cats prohibited to own in the US?</p>

<p>In the United States, fishing cats are classified as 'exotic' animals, and they fall under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).
