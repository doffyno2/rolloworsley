<p>A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection that affects any part of the urinary system, including the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. UTIs are typically caused by bacteria that enter the urinary tract and cause inflammation. While UTIs can occur at any age, they are more common in women than in men. Women are more likely to develop a UTI because of their shorter urethra, which allows bacteria to enter the urinary tract more easily.</p>

<p>It is possible for a UTI to affect your menstrual cycle. UTIs can interfere with the normal functioning of the reproductive system, which can lead to changes in the hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle. Additionally, UTIs can cause inflammation of the reproductive organs, which can interfere with ovulation and lead to changes in your menstrual cycle.</p>

<h2>What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a UTI?</h2>

<p>The most common symptom of a UTI is a burning sensation when urinating. Other symptoms may include a frequent urge to urinate, cloudy or dark-colored urine, pain in the lower abdomen, and a foul odor or taste in the urine. If the infection has spread to the kidneys, patients may experience fever, nausea, and back pain.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risk Factors for a UTI?</h2>

<p>There are several risk factors for developing a UTI. These include having a weakened immune system, sexual activity, using certain types of birth control, using a diaphragm or spermicide, being pregnant, having diabetes, and having kidney stones. Additionally, women are more likely to develop a UTI than men due to their shorter urethras.</p>

<h2>How Is a UTI Diagnosed and Treated?</h2>

<p>A UTI is usually diagnosed through a urine test, which can reveal the presence of bacteria or white blood cells in the urine. A doctor may also perform a physical examination and take a medical history. Treatment for a UTI typically involves antibiotics, which can be taken orally or intravenously. Additionally, drinking plenty of fluids and urinating frequently can help flush out the bacteria and reduce symptoms.</p>
