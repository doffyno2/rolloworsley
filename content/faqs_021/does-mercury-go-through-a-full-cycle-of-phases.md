<p>Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the Solar System. It has an orbital period of 88 days and is one of the planets in the Solar System that undergoes a full cycle of phases. This cycle is responsible for the planet's changing appearance from time to time, as seen from Earth. But what is the cycle of phases, and how does it work? This article will explain everything you need to know.</p>

<h2>What is the Cycle of Phases?</h2>

<p>The cycle of phases is the process of the planet's surface or atmosphere changing over time, as seen from Earth. This is due to the planet's relative position to the Sun in its orbit. When Mercury is in the same position relative to the Sun as Earth is, it will appear as a Full Moon to us. When it is at the farthest point from the Sun, it appears as a New Moon. As it moves from one point to the other, it goes through different phases which include waxing, waning and crescent phases.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Cycle of Phases?</h2>

<p>The cycle of phases is caused by the relative position of Mercury to the Sun. As Mercury orbits the Sun, it appears to move from one side of the Sun to the other, and back again. This causes the different phases that we see. As Mercury can move faster than Earth, it sometimes passes between us and the Sun, and appears as a New Moon. At other times, it is on the other side of the Sun and appears as a Full Moon. As it moves, it goes through different phases, such as waxing and waning.</p> 

<h2>What is Waxing and Waning?</h2>

<p>Waxing and waning is the process of the planet's appearance changing over time. During waxing, the planet appears to be getting larger, or waxing in size. This is the period between New Moon and Full Moon. During waning, the planet appears to be getting smaller, or waning in size. This is the period between Full Moon and New Moon.</p>

<h2>How Long Does the Cycle Last?</h2>

<p>The cycle of phases lasts for about 88 days. This is due to the fact that Mercury takes 88 days to orbit the Sun. During this time, Mercury will appear to go through all of its phases, from New Moon to Full Moon and back again.</p>

<h2>What are the Different Phases?</h2>

<p>The different phases of Mercury include waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gibbous, third quarter and waning crescent. During the waxing crescent phase, the planet will appear to be getting larger, from a very thin crescent to a more complete circle. During the first quarter phase, the planet will appear to be half full. During the waxing gibbous phase, the planet will appear to be getting larger, from half full to almost full. During the full phase, the planet will appear completely full. During the waning gibbous phase, the planet will appear to be getting smaller, from almost full to half full. During the third quarter phase, the planet will appear to be half full. During the waning crescent phase, the planet will appear to be getting smaller, from a more complete circle to a very thin crescent.</p>

<h2>Can We See the Phases From Earth?</h2>

<p>Yes, we can see the phases of Mercury from Earth. As Mercury orbits the Sun, it appears to move from one side of the Sun to the other. This causes the different phases that we see. However, due to its small size and its distance from Earth, it can be difficult to observe the planet's phases from Earth. To get a better view of the planet's phases, we need to use a telescope.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
