Minecraft is a popular sandbox video game that has attracted millions of fans around the world.

Hexxit is one such mod, allowing players to craft and repair items using a variety of materials from the game. One particularly interesting material is meteorite, which can be used to craft powerful tools and armor. But can you repair meteorite armor and tools in Hexxit?

<h2>What is Hexxit?</h2>

Hexxit is a custom mod for Minecraft, which adds a variety of new features to the game. These features include a wide selection of new blocks, mobs, items, and tools. One of the most interesting aspects of the mod is its support for custom material types, such as Meteorite. Meteorite can be used to craft powerful tools and armor, however it has one major drawback - it cannot be repaired with the standard anvil.

<h2>Can You Repair Meteorite Armor and Tools?</h2>

The short answer to this question is yes, you can repair meteorite armor and tools in Hexxit. However, it requires the use of a special tool called the Infernal Furnace. The Infernal Furnace is a unique block added by the mod which has the ability to repair any item crafted with Meteorite. To use the Infernal Furnace, simply place the item to be repaired in the top slot, and the repair material (typically iron ingots) in the bottom slot. The furnace will then repair the item using the repair material, allowing you to use it again.

<h2>Where Can I Find the Infernal Furnace?</h2>

The Infernal Furnace can be found in the Nether, specifically in the Blaze Fortress. The Blaze Fortress can be located by exploring the Nether and looking for a large, castle-like structure made out of nether bricks. Inside the fortress, you will find the Infernal Furnace, as well as a variety of other items.

<h2>What Other Repairs Can Be Done with the Infernal Furnace?</h2>

In addition to repairing meteorite armor and tools, the Infernal Furnace can also be used to repair enchanted items, such as armor and tools. This can be done by placing the item to be repaired in the top slot, and the repair material (typically lapis lazuli) in the bottom slot. The furnace will then repair the item using the repair material, allowing you to use it again.

<h2>Tips for Using the Infernal Furnace</h2>

When using the Infernal Furnace, it is important to remember a few key tips. Firstly, the Infernal Furnace can only repair one item at a time, so it is best to repair multiple items in batches. Secondly, the Infernal Furnace uses a lot of fuel when repairing items, so it is best to have plenty of coal available to avoid running out. Finally, the Infernal Furnace can only repair items crafted with Meteorite or Lapis Lazuli, so it is important to make sure the item you are trying to repair is crafted with one of these materials.
