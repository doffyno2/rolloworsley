Node_modules is a folder that contains all the packages, libraries, and dependencies that are used to run a Node.js application. It is used to manage the project’s dependencies and versions. While working on a project, it is important to keep the node_modules folder updated to ensure that the application runs smoothly.

But, when it comes to version control, it is a good practice to not include the node_modules folder in the repository. This is because the folder can take up a lot of space and can slow down the repository or even cause it to crash.

<h2>Why Should You Not Include Node_Modules in Your Repo?</h2>

The main reason why you should not include node_modules in your repository is because it takes up too much space. The folder can become extremely large due to the number of dependencies and packages that are being used. Additionally, it contains a lot of files which can slow down the repository and make it difficult to navigate.

Another reason why you should not include node_modules in your repository is that it can become outdated quickly. The packages and dependencies in the folder can become outdated as you update the project and add new ones. This means that the folder can become out of sync with the project which can lead to errors.

Finally, it is important to note that node_modules is a folder that is not needed for the project to work. It is only used to manage dependencies and packages. Therefore, it is not necessary to include it in the repository.

<h2>How to Delete Node_Modules from Your Repo?</h2>

It is easy to delete node_modules from your repository. All you need to do is open the terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project. Then, run the following command:

`rm -rf node_modules`

This command will delete the node_modules folder from your repository. Once the folder is deleted, you can commit the changes and push them to the repository.

<h2>What Should You Do After Deleting Node_Modules from Your Repo?</h2>

After deleting node_modules from your repository, it is important to run the `npm install` command in the terminal. This command will install all the necessary packages and dependencies that are needed for the project to run.

It is also a good idea to run the `npm update` command. This command will update all the packages and dependencies that are being used in the project. This will ensure that your project is up-to-date and running smoothly.
