The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most famous shipwrecks in history. The tragedy occurred in the early morning hours of April 15, 1912, when the ship struck an iceberg and sunk to the depths of the North Atlantic Ocean. The Titanic was considered to be unsinkable by many but it was the iceberg that proved otherwise. So, just how big was the iceberg?

<h2>The Size of the Iceberg</h2>

The size of the iceberg that sunk the Titanic is a matter of considerable debate. Estimates of its size range from anywhere between 50 and 100 feet in height and between 200 and 400 feet in length. It was estimated to have weighed between 200,000 and 600,000 metric tons. 

The iceberg was large enough to pose a significant threat to the Titanic, as it was much larger than the ship itself. The Titanic was 882 feet long, 92 feet wide, and 175 feet high, and weighed over 46,000 tons. In comparison, the iceberg was large enough to have easily capsized the ship and caused massive destruction to its hull. 

<h2>The Shape of the Iceberg</h2>

The shape of the iceberg is also a matter of debate. Some accounts suggest that it was a large, flat slab of ice that had broken off of a glacier and was floating in the North Atlantic. Others suggest that it was jagged and sharp, with sharp corners that posed a greater risk to the ship. 

The shape of the iceberg is important to consider as it likely contributed to the severity of the Titanicâ€™s destruction. If the iceberg had been a flat slab of ice, it may have been possible for the Titanic to avoid the collision or at least to suffer less damage. However, if the iceberg was jagged and sharp, it may have caused more severe damage to the hull of the ship and ultimately caused it to sink. 

<h2>The Color of the Iceberg</h2>

The color of the iceberg is also a matter of debate. Some accounts suggest that it was an icy blue color, while others suggest that it was white. The color of the iceberg may have been important in terms of visibility, as the Titanic was only able to spot the iceberg when it was within a few hundred yards of the ship. 

If the iceberg had been a darker color, it may have been more difficult for the Titanic to spot it in the darkness of the night. This could have led to the Titanic being unable to avoid the collision, as it did not have enough time to maneuver away from the iceberg. 

<h2>The Impact of the Iceberg</h2>

The impact of the iceberg on the Titanic was devastating. The collision caused extensive damage to the hull of the ship, which quickly began to take on water. The ship was unable to remain afloat and eventually sank to the depths of the North Atlantic Ocean. 

The impact of the iceberg on the Titanic was felt far beyond the ship itself. The sinking of the Titanic was an international tragedy, as over 1,500 lives were lost in the disaster. The tragedy also led to a number of changes in maritime safety regulations, as well as a greater awareness of the need for improved safety measures on board ships.
