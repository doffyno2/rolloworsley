Do Reps Convert When Faction Change?



Players in the popular game of World of Warcraft (WoW) will often change their faction in order to progress in the game. For example, if a player is a member of the Horde, they may switch to the Alliance in order to gain access to certain areas or quests. The question that many players have is whether or not their reputation points (or "reps") will convert over when they change factions.

The answer is generally yes, but it depends on the type of reputation point. There are two types of reputation points in WoW: faction-specific and cross-faction. Faction-specific reputation points are only earned and maintained within the same faction. If a player changes factions, then their faction-specific reputation points will be lost.

Cross-faction reputation points, on the other hand, will carry over when a player changes factions. These are generally earned through completing specific quests or activities, and are not tied to a particular faction. As long as the player has earned the required number of points, they will carry over when they switch factions.

<h2>How Do Faction Changes Affect Reputation Points?</h2>

When a player switches factions, they will lose any faction-specific reputation points they have earned. This means that if a player has earned a certain number of points with the Horde, those points will disappear when they switch to the Alliance. However, if the player has earned cross-faction reputation points, these will carry over when they switch factions.

<h2>How Can Players Earn Cross-Faction Reputation Points?</h2>

Cross-faction reputation points are earned through completing specific quests or activities. These are typically found in dungeons and raids, or through completing certain world events. They can also be earned by participating in PvP (Player vs Player) activities, such as battlegrounds and arenas.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Cross-Faction Reputation Points?</h2>

Cross-faction reputation points are useful for players who want to switch factions, as they will be able to retain their reputation points. This allows players to progress faster in the game, as they will not have to start from scratch when they switch factions.

Cross-faction reputation points are also useful for players who want to complete specific tasks or activities. For example, if a player wants to complete a specific quest or dungeon, they can use their cross-faction reputation points to gain access to it.

<h2>How Can Players Improve Their Reputation?</h2>

Players can improve their reputation by completing specific tasks or activities. This includes completing dungeons and raids, participating in PvP activities, or completing world events. By doing these activities, players can earn both faction-specific and cross-faction reputation points.

Players can also purchase items from special vendors that will improve their reputation. These items can be purchased with in-game gold or real money depending on the vendor.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

When a player changes factions in World of Warcraft, they will lose any faction-specific reputation points they have earned. However, cross-faction reputation points will carry over when they switch factions. These points are earned through completing specific quests or activities, and can be used to access certain areas or activities. Players can also improve their reputation by completing specific tasks or activities, or by purchasing items from special vendors.
