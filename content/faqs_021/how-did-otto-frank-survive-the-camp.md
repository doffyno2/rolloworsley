<p>Otto Frank was a German-born Jewish businessman who lived in Amsterdam during World War II. When the Nazis invaded the Netherlands in 1940, he was arrested and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. At Auschwitz, he endured terrible conditions and suffered from dysentery, starvation, and other illnesses. Despite all of this, Otto Frank survived the camp and eventually returned to Amsterdam in 1945. But how did he manage to survive the camp?</p>

<h2>The Kindness of Strangers</h2>

<p>Otto Frank was fortunate to receive help from an unexpected source: a group of Polish prisoners who had formed a secret organization to help their fellow inmates. This organization, known as the O.D.R.K. (Organization of Former Prisoners of Concentration Camps), provided food, clothing, and medical supplies to those in need. The O.D.R.K. was instrumental in helping Otto Frank survive the camp. In particular, they provided him with extra food rations, which helped him cope with the harsh conditions.</p>

<h2>The Strength of Faith</h2>

<p>Another factor that helped Otto Frank survive the camp was his strong faith. He was a devout Jew, and his faith provided him with strength and courage during his time in Auschwitz. He believed that his faith would ultimately protect him from harm, and he often found comfort in prayer. In addition, he was able to find solace in the Jewish community at Auschwitz, which provided him with a sense of hope and camaraderie.</p>

<h2>Adaptability</h2>

<p>Otto Frank was also able to survive the camp by adapting to the conditions. He learned to make the best of what he had, and he was able to find ways to make his life a little bit better. For example, he was able to obtain food from the camp's black market and even managed to obtain a job in the camp's kitchen. This job allowed him to obtain extra rations and helped him survive the camp.</p>

<h2>Luck</h2>

<p>Finally, luck also played a role in Otto Frank's survival. He was fortunate to receive help from the O.D.R.K. and he was lucky to have avoided the worst of the camp's horrors.
