<p>When it comes to dishwashing, Bosch dishwashers are among the most popular and efficient appliances on the market. But just how much water does a Bosch dishwasher use per cycle?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on the type of Bosch dishwasher you have. Different models use different amounts of water, and some models are more efficient than others. In general, however, Bosch dishwashers use between 3.5 and 6.5 gallons of water per cycle. This can vary depending on the type of cycle you use, as well as the type of dishes you are washing.</p>

<p>One of the most efficient Bosch dishwashers is the Bosch SilencePlus 44 dBA Dishwasher. This model uses just 3.5 gallons of water per cycle, making it one of the most water-efficient dishwashers on the market. It also has a special Sanitize cycle that uses an additional 1.5 gallons of water per cycle, making it even more efficient.</p>

<p>In contrast, the Bosch 500 Series Dishwasher uses 6.5 gallons of water per cycle. This is more than double the amount used by the SilencePlus 44 dBA.
