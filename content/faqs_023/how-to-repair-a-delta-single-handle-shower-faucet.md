<p>Are you experiencing a leaky or faulty Delta single handle shower faucet? Don't worry, it's an easy fix. With some basic tools, you can repair a Delta single handle shower faucet in no time. Read on for step-by-step instructions on how to fix your Delta shower faucet.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed for the Job</h2>

<p>Before you start, make sure you have the following tools and materials on hand:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adjustable wrench</li>
	<li>Flathead screwdriver</li>
	<li>New washers</li>
	<li>New O-ring</li>
	<li>Plumber's putty</li>
	<li>Pliers</li>
	<li>Teflon tape</li>
	<li>A rag</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Shut Off Water Supply</h2>

<p>The first step to any plumbing repair is to turn off the water supply. You can do this by turning off the shut-off valves located at the base of the faucet. Once the water is shut off, turn on the faucet to drain any remaining water from the system.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Handle</h2>

<p>Using an adjustable wrench, remove the handle from the faucet. Once the handle is removed, use a flathead screwdriver to remove the retaining clip from the valve stem. You may need to use a pair of pliers to help you remove the clip. Once the clip is removed, you can then remove the valve stem.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Replace the Washer and O-Ring</h2>

<p>Now that the valve stem is removed, you can access the washer and O-ring. Use a rag to clean off any debris from the area. Then, replace the old washer and O-ring with new ones. Make sure the new washer and O-ring are properly installed and secure.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Reinstall the Valve Stem</h2>

<p>Once the washer and O-ring are in place, you can reinstall the valve stem. First, wrap the threads of the valve stem with Teflon tape. This will help create a tight seal when the valve stem is installed. Then, reinstall the retaining clip and use an adjustable wrench to tighten the valve stem in place.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Reinstall the Handle</h2>

<p>Now that the valve stem is in place, you can reinstall the handle. Place the handle onto the valve stem and then use an adjustable wrench to tighten it in place. Once the handle is installed, you can then turn on the water supply and test the faucet.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Apply Plumber's Putty</h2>

<p>If the faucet is leaking, you may need to apply some plumber's putty. Apply the putty around the base of the faucet and then use a rag to spread it evenly. The putty will help create a water-tight seal and should stop the faucet from leaking.</p>
