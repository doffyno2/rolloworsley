<p>If you're looking into renting out your car with Turo, you may be wondering how old your car can be. Turo is an online car rental marketplace that allows car owners to rent out their vehicles to renters. The platform is highly flexible, making it a great option for those who want to make some extra money with their cars. But when it comes to the age of the car, there are some restrictions.</p>

<p>Turo has a couple of requirements when it comes to the age of cars listed on their platform. The first requirement is that the car must be no older than 15 years. This means that the car must be a 2003 model or newer. The second requirement is that the car must have fewer than 150,000 miles on the odometer. This is to ensure that the car is in good working condition and safe for renters.</p>

<p>In addition to the age and mileage requirements, Turo also has some other restrictions when it comes to cars listed on the platform. For example, cars must have a model year of 2003 or newer, and they must be in good condition with no major mechanical or cosmetic issues. Turo also requires that the car has full coverage insurance, including liability and collision coverage.</p>

<p>When it comes to the age of your car, Turo is not the only game in town. Other online car rental platforms, such as Getaround and HyreCar, have different requirements for the cars listed on their platforms. Getaround, for example, allows cars that are up to 20 years old, while HyreCar allows cars that are up to 22 years old.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of Renting Out Your Car with Turo?</h2>

<p>While there are several benefits to renting out your car with Turo, there are also some risks to consider. The first risk is that you may not make as much money as you’d like. Since you are setting your own rates, there is no guarantee that you’ll make a certain amount of money. You may end up making more or less than you had hoped.</p>

<p>Another risk is that you may be liable for any damage done to your car by a renter. If a renter damages your car, you may be responsible for paying for the repairs out of pocket. Turo does provide insurance coverage for damages, but you may still be liable for some of the costs.</p>
