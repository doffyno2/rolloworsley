<p>If you’re looking for an easy, no-scrub way to clean your stove top, then dryer sheets may be just the solution you need. Dryer sheets are great for getting rid of grease, grime, and baked-on food from your stove top. Plus, they are easy to use and require minimal effort. Here’s how you can use dryer sheets to clean your stove top.</p>

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, make sure you have all the supplies you need. You’ll need the following items:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dryer sheets</li>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Paper towels or a cloth</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Soak the Dryer Sheets</h2>

<p>The first step is to soak the dryer sheets in warm water. Make sure the water completely covers the sheets. Let them soak for about 10 minutes so they can absorb the water.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Apply the Sheets to the Stove Top</h2>

<p>Once the sheets are soaked, take one sheet and apply it to the surface of the stove top. Make sure the sheet is completely covering the surface. Let the sheet sit for a few minutes so it can work its magic.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Scrub the Stove Top</h2>

<p>Once the sheet has had a chance to sit, take a paper towel or cloth and begin scrubbing the sheet. The sheet should be able to easily remove grease and grime from the surface of the stove top. Continue scrubbing until the surface is clean.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Rinse and Wipe</h2>

<p>Once you’ve removed all the dirt and grime, take a damp cloth and rinse the surface of the stove top. This will help remove any remaining residue from the dryer sheet. Then take a dry cloth and wipe the surface until it is completely dry.</p>
