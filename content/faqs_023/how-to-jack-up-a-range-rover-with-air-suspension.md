<p>Range Rovers are one of the most luxurious vehicles on the road, and they come with a variety of features that make them stand out. One of these features is an air suspension system, which allows the ride height of the vehicle to be adjusted depending on the terrain and driving conditions. This air suspension system can also be used to jack up the vehicle when necessary. Here, we'll take a look at how to jack up a Range Rover with air suspension.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Gather the Necessary Tools and Supplies</h2>

<p>Before you start jacking up your Range Rover, you'll need to gather the necessary tools and supplies. You'll need an air compressor, an air hose, an air jack, a jack stand, and a wheel chock. Additionally, make sure you have plenty of space to work, as you'll need to be able to maneuver around the vehicle safely.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Prepare the Vehicle for the Jacking Process</h2>

<p>Before you start jacking up the vehicle, you'll need to make sure that it's secure and ready for the process. First, turn off the engine and apply the parking brake. Next, place the wheel chock behind one of the wheels so that the vehicle won't roll away while you're jacking it up. Finally, make sure that you're working on a level surface, as this will make the jacking process easier and safer.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Connect the Air Jack and Air Compressor</h2>

<p>Once you've gathered the necessary tools and supplies and prepared the vehicle for the jacking process, you can start connecting the air jack and air compressor. First, attach the air hose to the air jack, making sure that it's properly connected and sealed. Then, attach the other end of the air hose to the air compressor, and turn on the compressor.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Position the Air Jack</h2>

<p>Once the air jack is connected to the air compressor, you can position it beneath the vehicle. Make sure that the jack is positioned securely and that it won't move when you start jacking up the vehicle. Additionally, make sure that the jack is positioned close enough to the ground that you can easily access it when you're jacking up the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Begin the Jacking Process</h2>

<p>Once the air jack is in position, you can begin the jacking process. Start by turning on the air compressor and adjusting the pressure until the air jack starts to lift the vehicle. As the vehicle is being lifted, make sure that you're continually monitoring it to ensure that it's not being lifted too quickly or too slowly. Additionally, make sure that the air jack is positioned securely so that it doesn't move or shift while it's lifting the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Place the Jack Stand</h2>

<p>Once the vehicle has been lifted to the desired height, it's time to place the jack stand. Position the jack stand beneath the vehicle, making sure that it's secure and stable. Once the jack stand is in place, you can slowly lower the vehicle onto it. Make sure that the jack stand is positioned correctly before you lower the vehicle onto it.</p>

<h2>Step 7: Remove the Air Jack</h2>

<p>Once the vehicle has been lowered onto the jack stand, it's time to remove the air jack. Slowly release the air pressure from the air jack and then remove it from beneath the vehicle. Once the air jack has been removed, you can turn off the air compressor and disconnect the air hose from the air jack.</p>

<h2>Step 8: Secure the Vehicle</h2>

<p>Now that the vehicle has been jacked up, it's important to make sure that it's secure and stable. Check the jack stand to make sure that it's properly positioned beneath the vehicle and that it's not slipping or shifting. Additionally, make sure that the wheel chock is still in place to keep the vehicle from rolling away.</p>
