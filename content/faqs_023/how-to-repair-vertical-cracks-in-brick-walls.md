Brick walls are commonly used as a decorative feature in many homes and businesses, but they can also be prone to damage. Vertical cracks in brick walls are a common problem, and can be caused by a variety of factors including weather, ground movement, and even poor construction. Repairing these cracks requires some preparation and knowledge of the right techniques, but with a little bit of patience, the job can be done with relative ease.

<h2>What Causes Vertical Cracks in Brick Walls?</h2>

There are several factors that can cause vertical cracks in brick walls. One of the most common causes is weather-related. Extreme changes in temperature can cause the brick to contract and expand, which can lead to vertical cracks. Additionally, ground movement, whether due to natural shifts or construction, can cause vertical cracks in brick walls. Poor construction techniques can also be a factor, especially if the mortar used to join the bricks together was not properly applied.

<h2>How to Identify Vertical Cracks in Brick Walls</h2>

Identifying vertical cracks in brick walls is relatively straightforward. Generally, these cracks will run from the top to the bottom of the wall, and will be visible along the surface. However, it’s important to note that some cracks may not be visible from the surface, which is why it’s important to inspect the wall carefully to ensure that all vertical cracks have been identified.

<h2>Steps to Repair Vertical Cracks in Brick Walls</h2>

Repairing vertical cracks in brick walls is relatively straightforward. The steps below outline the process: 

<h3>Step 1: Clean the Wall</h3>

The first step in repairing vertical cracks in brick walls is to clean the wall thoroughly. This will help to ensure that the repair materials will stick properly. Use a stiff brush to remove any loose debris and dirt from the wall, and then rinse the wall with a hose or pressure washer. Allow the wall to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.

<h3>Step 2: Prepare the Mortar</h3>

Once the wall is clean and dry, the next step is to prepare the mortar. For best results, use a premixed mortar that is designed for brickwork. Follow the instructions on the package for proper mixing, and then use a trowel to apply a thin layer of mortar to the wall, covering the entire crack. Allow the mortar to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.

<h3>Step 3: Apply the Mortar</h3>

Once the mortar has dried, it’s time to apply the mortar to the wall. Use a trowel to apply a thin layer of mortar over the prepared area, and then use a pointing tool to press the mortar into the crack. Make sure to fill the crack completely, and then use a damp sponge to smooth the mortar over the wall. Allow the mortar to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.

<h3>Step 4: Apply the Sealant</h3>

Once the mortar has dried, the next step is to apply a sealant to the wall. This will help to prevent moisture from penetrating the wall and causing further damage. Use a caulking gun to apply a high-quality sealant to the area, and then use a damp sponge to smooth the sealant over the wall. Allow the sealant to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.

<h3>Step 5: Apply the Paint</h3>

Once the sealant has dried, it’s time to apply a coat of paint. Use a paintbrush to apply a coat of high-quality exterior paint to the wall, and then allow the paint to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.

<h3>Step 6: Apply the Sealant Again</h3>

Once the paint has dried, the final step is to apply a second coat of sealant. Use a caulking gun to apply a second coat of sealant to the wall, and then use a damp sponge to smooth the sealant over the wall. Allow the sealant to dry completely before proceeding to the next step.
