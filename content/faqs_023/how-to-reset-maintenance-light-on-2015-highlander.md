<p>If you own a 2015 Highlander, you may have noticed a Maintenance Required light on the dash. This light is a reminder to you that it’s time to bring your vehicle into a qualified service center to have the maintenance and repairs done that are due. Fortunately, resetting the maintenance light on a 2015 Highlander is a relatively easy process that anyone can do. </p>

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

<p>Before you can begin the resetting process, you will need to have certain tools on hand. The tools you will need are: </p>

<ul>
<li>A Phillips head screwdriver</li>
<li>A flat head screwdriver</li>
<li>A socket set</li>
<li>A digital multi-meter</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step One: Locate the ECM</h2>

<p>The first step in resetting the Maintenance light on a 2015 Highlander is to locate the ECM, or Electronic Control Module. This is a small box that is located just below the driver’s side of the dash. You will need to remove the dash panel in order to access the ECM.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Disconnect the battery</h2>

<p>The next step is to disconnect the battery. This will help to ensure that no electrical current is flowing through the wires while you are working on the ECM. To do this, you will need to locate the negative battery cable and loosen the nut that holds it in place. Once the nut is loose, you can pull the cable away from the battery.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Remove the ECM</h2>

<p>Once the battery is disconnected, you can begin to remove the ECM. To do this, you will need to remove the screws that hold the ECM in place. Once the screws are removed, you can carefully pull the ECM out from the dash. Be sure to take note of any wires that are connected to the ECM, as you will need to reconnect them once the resetting process is complete.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Test the Connections</h2>

<p>Once the ECM is removed, you can begin testing the connections. To do this, you will need to use a digital multi-meter. This will help to ensure that all of the connections are working properly. If there are any broken or loose wires, you will need to repair them before continuing.</p>

<h2>Step Five: Replace the ECM</h2>

<p>Once all of the connections have been tested and any repairs have been made, you can begin to re-install the ECM. To do this, you will need to reconnect all of the wires and then tighten the screws to hold it in place. Once the ECM is installed, you can reconnect the battery.</p>

<h2>Step Six: Reset the Maintenance Light</h2>

<p>The final step in resetting the Maintenance light on a 2015 Highlander is to reset the light itself. To do this, you will need to locate the OBD-II port and plug in a code reader. Once the code reader is plugged in, you can access the Maintenance light settings and reset the light.</p>
