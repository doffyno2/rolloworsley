Pilling, or small pieces of lint or fuzz, is a common occurrence on blankets. It is not only unsightly, but it can also ruin the look of the fabric. Fortunately, there are several easy ways to remove pilling from blankets. With a few simple steps, you can have your blanket looking new again.

<h2>What Causes Pilling?</h2>

Pilling on blankets is caused by the friction between the fabric and the surface it is in contact with, such as a bed or chair. As the fabric rubs against the surface, it loosens the fibers of the fabric, resulting in pilling. The more the fabric is rubbed against a surface, the more pilling will occur.

<h2>How to Remove Pilling from Blankets</h2>

<h3>1. Vacuuming</h3>

The easiest and quickest way to remove pilling from a blanket is to vacuum it. A handheld or regular vacuum with a soft brush attachment should do the trick. Simply turn the vacuum on and use the brush attachment to gently brush away the pilling. Make sure to move the vacuum slowly so that you don't damage the fabric.

<h3>2. Use a Lint Remover</h3>

Another easy way to remove pilling from your blanket is to use a lint remover. Lint removers are small handheld devices that remove lint and fuzz from fabrics. Simply roll the lint remover over the blanket in a back and forth motion. The lint will be collected in the container of the lint remover. Once you have finished, empty the container and repeat.

<h3>3. Use an Electric Shaver</h3>

If you don't have a lint remover, an electric shaver can also be used to remove pilling from blankets. An electric shaver is a small device that uses a rotating blade to remove lint and fuzz from fabrics. To use an electric shaver, simply turn it on and move it slowly over the blanket. Make sure to go over the same area multiple times to ensure that all of the pilling is removed.

<h3>4. Use a Pumice Stone</h3>

A pumice stone is a great way to remove pilling from blankets. To use a pumice stone, simply dampen the stone and rub it gently over the surface of the blanket. The pumice stone will act like an abrasive and will remove the pilling. Make sure to be gentle when rubbing the stone over the fabric so that you don't damage it.
