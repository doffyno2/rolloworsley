<p>As a responsible pet owner, it’s important to keep your dog clean, healthy, and smelling fresh. Most dogs require regular baths, but depending on the breed and the environment, you may find yourself needing to give your dog a bath more or less often. Fortunately, there are some easy ways to keep your pup smelling fresh between baths.</p>

<h2>Brush Regularly</h2>

<p>Regular brushing of your dog's coat will help remove dirt, debris and loose fur, as well as stimulate the skin and promote a healthy coat. Depending on the breed, brush your pup's coat at least once a week with a bristle brush, slicker brush, or rubber curry brush. For long-haired dogs, use a wide-toothed comb to remove tangles, and for short-haired dogs, use a stiff bristle brush. After brushing, wipe your pup down with a wet cloth or damp towel to remove any remaining fur or dirt.</p>

<h2>Clean Ears and Teeth</h2>

<p>Dirty ears and teeth can lead to infections and bad breath, so it’s important to keep them clean. Use a cleaning solution specifically made for dogs to clean their ears and teeth. For ears, use a cotton ball or pet ear cleaner to gently wipe the inside and outside of the ear. For teeth, use a pet toothbrush and toothpaste to brush your pup’s teeth twice a week. If your dog doesn’t like having their teeth brushed, you can also use dental treats or chews to help remove plaque and bacteria.</p>

<h2>Bathe With Dry Shampoo</h2>

<p>Dry shampoo is a great way to keep your pup smelling fresh between baths. Dry shampoo is made specifically for dogs, and can be used to absorb excess oil, dirt, and odor. It’s easy to apply — simply sprinkle it over your pup’s coat and massage it in. Leave it on for a few minutes, then brush it out. It’s important to note that dry shampoo is not a substitute for regular bathing, and should only be used in between baths.</p>

<h2>Keep Nails Trimmed</h2>

<p>Long nails can cause discomfort for your pup and make it more difficult for them to move around. Trim your pup’s nails every few weeks to keep them at a comfortable length. Be sure to use a nail clipper specifically designed for dogs, and make sure to avoid the quick, which is the pink part of the nail that contains blood vessels and nerves. If you’re unfamiliar with the process, ask your vet or a groomer for help.</p>

<h2>Wash Dog Bedding</h2>

<p>Your pup’s bedding should be washed at least once a week to keep it clean and smelling fresh. Use a mild detergent and warm water, and be sure to remove any clumps of dirt or debris before washing. Allow the bedding to air dry, or tumble dry on low heat. This will help keep your pup’s bedding clean and free of odors.</p>

<h2>Clean Dog Toys</h2>

<p>Your pup’s toys can get pretty dirty and smelly over time, so it’s important to clean them regularly. Wash plush toys in the washing machine with a mild detergent, and let them air dry. For non-plush toys, you can use a diluted solution of dish soap and warm water and scrub them with a brush. Be sure to rinse the toys thoroughly, and let them air dry.</p>
