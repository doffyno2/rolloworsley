<h2>What Causes a Bathtub Drain to Rust?</h2>

Rust is a common issue when it comes to bathtub drains. Rust can occur from a variety of sources, but is typically caused by one of two things: exposure to water and exposure to air. When water seeps into the drain, it can cause the metal to corrode and eventually start to rust. Similarly, when air is allowed to get into the drain, it can cause oxidation, which can lead to rust.

<h2>What Are the Signs of a Rusty Bathtub Drain?</h2>

The signs of a rusty bathtub drain are fairly easy to spot. The most obvious sign is rust on the drain itself, which can range from a light brown color to a deep red color. Other signs include discoloration of the metal around the drain, water not draining properly, and a musty smell coming from the drain.

<h2>How to Repair a Rusty Bathtub Drain</h2>

Repairing a rusty bathtub drain can be done in a few simple steps. Before beginning, it's important to make sure that all of the necessary supplies are on hand, including a drain cleaner, a metal brush, a wire brush, and a sealant.

<h3>Step 1: Prepare the Drain</h3>

The first step in repairing a rusty bathtub drain is to prepare the drain for the repair job. Start by using a wire brush to remove as much of the rust as possible. If there is a significant amount of rust, a metal brush may also be needed. Once the rust has been removed, use a drain cleaner to clean the drain and remove any remaining residue.

<h3>Step 2: Apply the Sealant</h3>

Once the drain has been adequately cleaned, it's time to apply the sealant. Start by applying a thin layer of sealant around the edges of the drain to create a waterproof barrier. Make sure to apply the sealant evenly around the entire circumference of the drain. Allow the sealant to dry completely before continuing.

<h3>Step 3: Finishing Touches</h3>

Once the sealant has dried, it's time to finish the repair job. Apply a thin layer of sealant over the entire surface of the drain to create a waterproof seal. This will help to protect the drain from future rusting. Allow the sealant to dry completely before using the bathtub.
