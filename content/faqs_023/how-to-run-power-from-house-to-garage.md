<p>Running power from your house to your garage is an important part of ensuring that the space is properly lit and secure. It also provides the convenience of being able to have power in the garage for any projects or activities that you may want to do. This article will provide an overview of the steps involved in running power from your house to your garage.</p>

<h2>Gather the Necessary Materials</h2>

<p>The first step in running power from your house to your garage is to gather all of the necessary materials. You will need to purchase a subpanel, which is a kind of circuit breaker box. You will also need to purchase a length of electrical wire, which should be long enough to reach from the house to the garage. You should also purchase a conduit, which is a tube that will protect the wiring from the elements. You will also need a surge protector, which will help protect your devices from any sudden power surges.</p>

<h2>Install the Subpanel</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered all of the necessary materials, you will need to install the subpanel in the garage. This should be done in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer of the subpanel. You will need to ensure that the subpanel is properly grounded in order to prevent any shocks or fires. You should also take the time to label each circuit breaker in the subpanel so that you can easily identify which circuits are connected to which devices.</p>

<h2>Run the Wire From the House to the Garage</h2>

<p>The next step is to run the electrical wire from the house to the garage. You should make sure to use the conduit to protect the wiring from the elements. You will also need to make sure that the wiring is properly secured at each end to prevent any accidents.

<h2>Install the Surge Protector</h2>

<p>Once the wiring has been run, the next step is to install the surge protector. This will help to protect your devices from any sudden power surges, which can be dangerous. The surge protector should be installed close to the subpanel in order to provide the best possible protection. It is also important to ensure that the surge protector is properly grounded in order to prevent any shocks or fires.</p>

<p>The last step is to connect the wiring to the subpanel. This should be done in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.
