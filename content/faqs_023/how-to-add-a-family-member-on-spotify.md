<h2>What is Spotify?</h2>

Spotify is one of the world's most popular streaming services, offering users access to millions of songs, albums, playlists, radio stations and more. With more than 140 million active users, Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming services in the world. Spotify is available in more than 60 countries and offers users a variety of ways to access music, including through a desktop app, mobile app, and web player.

<h2>What is a Family Member on Spotify?</h2>

A family member on Spotify is an account that is linked to a primary account. The primary account is created and managed by the original user, while the family members are added by the primary account holder. Each family member has their own account, but the primary account holder pays for the entire family's subscription. With a family plan, up to six family members can share a single subscription and access the same music library.

<h2>How to Add a Family Member on Spotify</h2>

Adding a family member to your Spotify account is a simple process. Follow the steps below to get started:

<h3>Step 1: Go to the Family Page</h3>

The first step to adding a family member is to visit the Family page. On the Family page, you can view information about your current family members, as well as add new members. To get to the Family page, log into your Spotify account and click “Account” in the top right corner. On the Account page, click “Subscription” and then select “Family” from the drop-down menu.

<h3>Step 2: Invite a Family Member</h3>

Once you are on the Family page, you can invite a family member to join your account. To do this, click “Invite Family Member” and enter the email address of the person you would like to add. You can also add a family member by sending them an invite link.

<h3>Step 3: Confirm the Invite</h3>

Once you have sent the invite, the family member will need to confirm it. They will receive an email with a link to confirm the invite. Once they click this link, they will be added to your family plan.

<h3>Step 4: Set up the Family Member's Account</h3>

Once the family member has confirmed the invite, they will need to set up their account. They will need to create a username and password, as well as provide payment information. The primary account holder will be responsible for paying for the family plan, so the family member does not need to provide payment information.
