<p>A riding mower is a great way to get your lawn maintenance done quickly and efficiently. For those who have a Craftsman riding mower, you may find that there are safety switches that need to be bypassed in order to get the mower going. This article will explain how to bypass all the safety switches on a Craftsman riding mower so that you can get back to mowing your lawn. </p>

<h2>What Are Safety Switches?</h2>

<p>Safety switches are devices that are meant to prevent the mower from being operated without the owner's permission. These switches are located in various places on the mower and are designed to stop the engine from running if they are not engaged. This is an important safety feature that prevents the mower from being operated by someone who is not familiar with it and could potentially cause an accident. </p>

<h2>How to Bypass the Safety Switches</h2>

<h3>Step One: Find the Safety Switches</h3>

<p>The first step in bypassing the safety switches is to locate them. On a Craftsman riding mower, the safety switches are typically located on the dash, near the steering wheel. They will be the red and yellow switches that are clearly labeled as safety switches. </p>

<h3>Step Two: Disengage the Safety Switches</h3>

<p>Once you have located the safety switches, you will need to disengage them. This can be done by simply pushing the red switch up and the yellow switch down. This will disengage the safety switches and allow you to start the mower. </p>

<h3>Step Three: Start the Mower</h3>

<p>Once the safety switches have been disengaged, you can start the mower by turning the key on the dash. The mower should start right away and you can begin mowing your lawn. </p>
