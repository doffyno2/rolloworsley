<h2>Introduction to Presta Valves</h2>

Presta valves are a type of valve found on most modern road and mountain bike tubes. The valve is typically made of metal and consists of an inner valve core, an outer valve sleeve, and a locking nut. The valve core is the part of the valve that is inserted into the tube and is what allows air to enter and exit the tube. The outer valve sleeve is the part of the valve that is visible when the valve is installed. The locking nut is used to secure the valve core in place.

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Remove the Valve Core</h3>

The first step is to remove the valve core from the Presta valve. To do this, you will need to use a valve core remover. This is a small tool that fits into the head of the valve and is used to unscrew the valve core. Once the valve core has been removed, you can move on to the next step.

<h3>Step 2: Attach the Pump</h3>
