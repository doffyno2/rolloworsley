A low refresh rate can cause the image to appear blurry and distorted, leading to ghosting. Another common cause is a poor connection between the TV and the input source. This can be caused by faulty HDMI cables, incorrect settings, or inadequate hardware.

If it’s set too low, you can try increasing it by going into the TV’s settings menu. You may also want to check the input source and make sure that the connection is secure and that the cables are in good condition. If the problem persists, you may want to consult the manufacturer’s manual for further instructions.

<h2>How to Prevent Ghosting on LED TV</h2>
