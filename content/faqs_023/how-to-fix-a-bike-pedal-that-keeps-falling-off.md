<p>It can be incredibly frustrating to have a bike pedal that keeps falling off. Not only is it an annoyance to have to constantly stop and reattach your pedal, but it can also be a safety hazard if your pedal falls off while you’re riding. Luckily, the issue is often easy to fix and doesn’t require too much technical knowledge. Here’s how to fix a bike pedal that keeps falling off.</p>

<h2>Check the Pedal and Threads</h2>

<p>The first step to fixing a falling-off bike pedal is to make sure the pedal is securely in place. To do this, twist the pedal to make sure it is firmly attached. If it is loose, you may need to tighten it. To do this, you will need a pedal wrench or a 6-millimeter Allen wrench. Insert the wrench into the pedal and turn it clockwise to tighten it.</p>

<p>If the pedal turns too easily, then it may mean that there is something wrong with the threads. To check this, remove the pedal and look inside the crank arm. If there is visible damage, then you should replace the pedal or the crank arm. If there is no visible damage, then you may need to re-thread the crank arm.</p>

<h2>Re-Thread the Crank Arm</h2>

<p>If the threads of the crank arm are damaged, then you will need to re-thread them. To do this, you will need a tap and die set, a hammer, and some lubricant. Start by lubricating the threads of the crank arm, then insert the tap into the crank arm and gently tap it in with the hammer. This will clean and re-thread the crank arm.</p>

<p>Once the tap is in place, you can use the die to create new threads. Start by inserting the die into the crank arm and turning it clockwise to create the new threads. Once the threads are created, you can remove the tap and die, clean the crank arm, and reattach the pedal.</p>

<h2>Check the Pedal and Chainrings</h2>

<p>Another possible cause of a falling-off bike pedal is a worn-out pedal. To determine if this is the problem, inspect the pedal and the chainrings for any visible wear or damage. If the pedal is visibly worn, then you should replace it. If the chainrings are worn, then you should also replace them.</p>

<h2>Check the Pedal Bearings</h2>

<p>If the pedal is not worn out and the threads are in good condition, then the next step is to check the pedal bearings. To do this, you will need to remove the pedal from the crank arm and inspect the bearings. If the bearings are worn or damaged, then you should replace the pedal. If the bearings are in good condition, then you should lubricate them with a lubricant specifically designed for bike pedals.</p>

<h2>Check the Shoe Strap</h2>

<p>If all of the above steps have been completed and the pedal is still falling off, then the last step is to check the shoe strap. To do this, remove the shoe strap and inspect it for any signs of wear or damage. If the shoe strap is worn out, then you should replace it with a new one.</p>
