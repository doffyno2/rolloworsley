<p>Knee sleeves are a great way to provide support, stability, and warmth to your knees while you’re exercising. But one of the most common complaints about knee sleeves is that they can slip down, which can be incredibly irritating and distracting. Fortunately, there are a few simple tricks you can use to keep your knee sleeve from slipping down.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Size Sleeve</h2>

<p>The most important step to keeping your knee sleeve from slipping down is to make sure you buy the right size. If the sleeve is too small, it may fit snugly around your knee, but it won’t be able to stay in place because it won’t have enough material to grab onto your skin. Conversely, if the sleeve is too big, it may fit loosely around your knee and won’t be able to stay in place because there won’t be enough tension. It’s important to measure your knee before purchasing a sleeve, so you can make sure you get the right size.</p>

<h2>Try a Different Material</h2>

<p>The material of the sleeve can also make a difference in how well it stays in place. Generally, sleeves made of neoprene or spandex are the most effective at keeping your sleeve from slipping down. Neoprene is a stiffer material, so it will provide more support and stability, while spandex is a stretchier material that hugs the contours of your knee better. Both materials are breathable, so they won’t cause your leg to overheat.</p>

<h2>Wear Compression Shorts</h2>

<p>If you’re still having trouble keeping your sleeve in place, you may want to try wearing compression shorts under your sleeve. Compression shorts are designed to provide extra support and stability to your legs, and they can help keep your sleeve from slipping down. Be sure to choose a pair that fits snugly but isn’t too tight, so you can still move freely and comfortably.</p>

<h2>Adjust the Straps</h2>

<p>Some knee sleeves also come with adjustable straps that can help keep the sleeve in place. If your sleeve has straps, make sure they’re adjusted snugly but not too tightly, so you can still move freely and comfortably. The straps should be adjusted so that the sleeve fits firmly against your skin, but not so tightly that it cuts off circulation.</p>
