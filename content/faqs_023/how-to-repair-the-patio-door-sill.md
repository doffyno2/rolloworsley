Patio door sills are an important part of ensuring that your patio door operates efficiently and looks great. Damage to a patio door sill can result in water leaking into the home, drafts and even the door not opening and closing properly. Fortunately, there is a way to simply and easily repair a patio door sill.

<h2>What Tools Are Required to Repair a Patio Door Sill?</h2>

Before attempting to repair a patio door sill, itâ€™s important to make sure you have all the necessary tools. These include a putty knife, a hammer, a chisel, a handsaw, a drill, a screwdriver, some wood glue, wood screws, wood putty and sandpaper.

<h2>Steps to Repair a Patio Door Sill</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Removing the Damaged Sill</h3>

The first step in repairing a patio door sill is to remove the damaged sill. Begin by using the putty knife to gently pry off the damaged sill. If the sill is very damaged and has broken into several pieces, you may need to use a hammer and a chisel to carefully remove the sill.

<h3>Step 2: Measuring and Cutting the New Sill</h3>

Once the damaged sill has been removed, measure the area carefully and use a handsaw to cut the new sill to the correct size. Make sure that the new sill is slightly larger than the area it needs to fit in to allow for proper fitting.

<h3>Step 3: Fitting the New Sill</h3>

The next step is to fit the new sill in place. Begin by applying wood glue to the edges of the new sill and then carefully fit it in place. Use the drill to drill pilot holes and then use wood screws to secure the new sill in place.

<h3>Step 4: Sealing the New Sill</h3>

Once the new sill is securely in place, it's time to seal it. Begin by applying a generous amount of wood putty to any gaps or cracks between the new sill and the surrounding area. Use sandpaper to smooth out any rough edges and then apply a sealant such as silicone caulk to seal the new sill in place.

<h3>Step 5: Finishing the Repair</h3>

Once the new sill is sealed, the repair is complete. All that's left to do is to clean up any excess putty or sealant and then enjoy your newly repaired patio door sill.
