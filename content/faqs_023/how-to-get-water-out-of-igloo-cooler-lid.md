<p>Having an Igloo cooler is an excellent way to keep food and drinks cold for an extended period of time. But when you’re done with your outing, you’re often left with a pool of condensation on the top of the cooler lid. If you’re not careful, this water can get into the cooler and soak into the food and drinks. So how do you get the water out of the cooler lid? Read on to find out.</p>

<h2>Why Does Water Collect on the Lid of an Igloo Cooler?</h2>

<p>The main reason water collects on the lid of an Igloo cooler is because of condensation. Condensation occurs when water molecules in the air come into contact with a colder surface, like the lid of an Igloo cooler. As the molecules come into contact with the cooler surface, they form tiny droplets of water that accumulate on the lid. This is why you’ll often find water droplets on the surface of an Igloo cooler lid, even if it hasn’t been used recently.</p>

<h2>How to Remove Water From the Lid of an Igloo Cooler</h2>

<p>The best way to remove water from the lid of an Igloo cooler is to use a cloth or paper towel. Simply wet the cloth or paper towel with warm water and then wipe down the surface of the lid. This will help to remove any excess water that has collected on the lid. You can also use a dry cloth or paper towel to dry the lid after wiping it down. This will help to keep the lid from accumulating any more water.</p>
