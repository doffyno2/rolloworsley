<h2>Using a Microwave</h2>

<p>If you’re in a rush, you can use your microwave to roast marshmallows. Place the marshmallows on a plate and microwave on high for 15-20 seconds. The marshmallows will puff up and become golden brown. Be careful when handling the plate as it will be very hot!</p> 

<h2>Using a Toaster Oven</h2>

<p>If you’re a fan of toaster ovens, you can use one to roast marshmallows as well. Preheat the toaster oven to 375°F and place the marshmallows on a baking sheet. Bake for 3-4 minutes, or until the marshmallows are puffed and golden brown. Be sure to keep an eye on them so that they don’t burn!</p> 

<h2>Using a Grill</h2>

<p>If you have a gas or charcoal grill, you can use it to roast marshmallows. Preheat the grill to medium heat and place the marshmallows on a skewer.

<h2>Using a Fondue Pot</h2>
