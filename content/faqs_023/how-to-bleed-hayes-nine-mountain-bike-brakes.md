<p>If you own a Hayes Nine mountain bike, you know that it is equipped with some of the best brakes available. The Hayes Nine brake system is a great choice for any mountain biker, as it provides powerful and reliable braking, allowing you to stop quickly and safely. However, in order for these brakes to work properly, they must be bled regularly. Bleeding the brakes is an essential part of maintaining your Hayes Nine mountain bike, and it is important to do it correctly in order to ensure that your brakes are working properly.</p>

<h2>What Is Bleeding the Brakes?</h2>

<p>Bleeding the brakes is the process of removing air and old brake fluid from the brake system, and replacing it with fresh, new brake fluid. Air bubbles can build up in the brake system, and this can cause the brakes to feel spongy or unresponsive. This can be a dangerous situation, as it reduces the effectiveness of your brakes. Bleeding the brakes helps to ensure that the brakes are functioning properly and that you have a safe and reliable braking system.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed for Bleeding the Brakes</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you need to make sure that you have all of the necessary tools. You will need a brake bleeding kit, which usually includes a syringe, a tube, and some brake fluid. You will also need a wrench, a screwdriver, and a pair of pliers. Additionally, you may need some brake cleaner, brake grease, and some rags.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Bleeding the Hayes Nine Mountain Bike Brakes</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Preparing the Bike</h3>

<p>The first step is to prepare the bike. Make sure that the bike is on a flat surface and that the brakes are fully engaged. Use the wrench to loosen the brake caliper bolts, and then use the screwdriver to loosen the brake levers. Once the brakes are loosened, you can remove the pads from the calipers.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Preparing the Bleeding Kit</h3>

<p>Next, you will need to prepare the bleeding kit. Fill the syringe with the appropriate amount of brake fluid, and then attach the tube to the syringe. Make sure that the tube is securely attached and that there are no leaks.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Bleeding the Brakes</h3>

<p>Now you are ready to begin the process of bleeding the brakes. Start by inserting the tube into the caliper, and then pump the syringe until you see a steady stream of brake fluid coming out of the tube. Once the fluid is flowing freely, you can remove the tube and close the caliper.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Finishing Up</h3>

<p>Once you have finished bleeding the brakes, you can replace the pads and re-tighten the brake levers and caliper bolts. Make sure that the brakes are firmly attached, and then use the brake cleaner and brake grease to lubricate the pads. Finally, clean up any excess brake fluid and make sure that the brakes are functioning properly.</p>
