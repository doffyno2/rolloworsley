<p>When it comes to irrigation systems, few are as reliable and durable as those from Rainbird. The brass valves that Rainbird uses in its irrigation systems have been known to last for decades, even in harsh outdoor conditions. Unfortunately, even the most reliable and well-made brass valves can eventually wear out and start to leak. To help you keep your Rainbird irrigation system in perfect working order, here is a step-by-step guide to repairing your old leaking brass valve.</p> 

<h2>Step 1: Locate the Leak</h2>

<p>The first step in any valve repair is to locate the source of the leak. This can be done by examining the valve body for any signs of corrosion or damage, such as cracks or scratches. If the valve is leaking from the handle, check for any cracks in the handle itself. You may also need to check the valve stem and gasket for any signs of wear or damage. If the valve is leaking from the threaded connection, check for corrosion or damage to the threads.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Clean the Valve</h2>

<p>Once you have located the source of the leak, it is important to thoroughly clean the valve before attempting to repair it. This can be done using a soft cloth and a mild detergent. Make sure to pay special attention to any areas that may be corroded or damaged, as these will need to be repaired before the valve can be put back into service.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Repair the Damage</h2>

<p>Depending on the extent of the damage, you may be able to repair the valve yourself. If the valve stem is corroded or damaged, you may need to replace it with a new one. If the handle is cracked or damaged, you may be able to repair it with epoxy. If the threaded connection is corroded or damaged, you may need to replace it with a new one. In any case, make sure to use the correct parts for your valve.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Test the Valve</h2>

<p>Once you have repaired the damage, it is important to test the valve to ensure that it is functioning properly. To do this, fill the valve with water and then open and close the handle to ensure that the valve is operating properly. If the valve is not operating properly, you may need to make additional repairs or replace the part.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Reinstall the Valve</h2>

<p>Once you have tested the valve and confirmed that it is functioning properly, you can reinstall it into your irrigation system. Before doing so, however, make sure to check the valve and the surrounding area for any signs of corrosion or damage. If any damage is found, it is important to repair or replace the part before reinstalling the valve.</p>
