<h2>Steps for Dehydrating Chicken Hearts</h2>

<p>To start, you will need to gather your ingredients and supplies. You will need chicken hearts, a sharp knife, a cutting board, and a dehydrator. Once you have all the items, you can begin the process of making your treats.</p>

<h3>Step 1: Preparing the Chicken Hearts</h3>

<p>The first step to making your treats is to prepare the chicken hearts. Start by washing the hearts to remove any dirt and grime. Then, cut the hearts into smaller pieces.

<h3>Step 2: Place the Pieces in the Dehydrator</h3>

<p>Once the chicken hearts are prepared, itâ€™s time to place them in the dehydrator. Place the pieces on the dehydrator trays in a single layer. Make sure the pieces are not overlapping so they will dry evenly. Close the dehydrator and set the temperature to 145 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Dehydrate the Pieces</h3>
