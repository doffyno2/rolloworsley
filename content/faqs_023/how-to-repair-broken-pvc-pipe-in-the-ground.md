<p>If you have a broken PVC pipe in the ground, you may be wondering what your options are for repair. PVC pipes are one of the most commonly used piping materials, due to their low cost and durability. Unfortunately, they are also prone to damage, either from digging, tree roots, or just age. Whatever the cause of the damage, it is important to repair the broken PVC pipe in the ground quickly and correctly, to prevent further damage or water loss.</p>

<h2>How to Identify a Broken PVC Pipe</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a broken PVC pipe is to identify the location and extent of the damage. Depending on the type of damage, it may be difficult to see the broken pipe, as it may be buried or covered in dirt or other debris. If you suspect that the pipe is broken, you should first try to locate the break. This can be done by using a metal detector, or by carefully digging around the suspected area until you find the damaged section. Once you have identified the exact location of the break, you can then proceed to the next step in the repair process.</p>

<h2>Gathering the Necessary Materials</h2>

<p>Once you have located the break, you will need to gather the necessary materials for the repair. These include a PVC pipe cutter, PVC cement, primer, and a patch that is appropriate for the size and type of pipe you are repairing. Before beginning the repair, make sure that all of the necessary materials are available and that you have read and understand the manufacturer's instructions for each product.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Pipe for Repair</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered the necessary materials, you will need to prepare the pipe for repair. This can be done by cleaning the area around the break with a wire brush or other suitable tool. It is important to remove any dirt, debris, or other obstructions that may be preventing a proper seal. Once the area is clean, you will need to cut out the damaged section of pipe. This can be done with a PVC pipe cutter, which can be purchased at most hardware stores. Once the damaged section has been removed, you will need to clean the remaining edges of the pipe with a wire brush, to ensure that they are clean and free of debris.</p>

<h2>Applying the Cement and Primer</h2>

<p>Once the pipe has been prepared, you will need to apply the PVC cement and primer to the edge of the pipe. First, apply the primer to the edge of the pipe, making sure that all of the surfaces are covered. Once the primer has been applied, you will need to apply the PVC cement. This should be done in a thin layer, making sure that all of the surfaces are covered. Allow the cement to dry for the amount of time specified in the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<h2>Applying the Patch</h2>

<p>Once the cement and primer have been applied and allowed to dry, you are ready to apply the patch. The patch should be cut to fit the size and shape of the damaged section of pipe. Once the patch is in place, you will need to apply the PVC cement to both sides of the patch. Once the cement has been applied, you will need to press the patch firmly into place. Allow the cement to dry for the amount of time specified in the manufacturer's instructions.</p>

<h2>Testing the Repair</h2>

<p>Once the patch has been applied and allowed to dry, you will need to test the repair to make sure that it is secure. This can be done by filling the pipe with water and checking for any leaks. If there are no leaks, then the repair is successful. If there are any leaks, then you will need to repeat the entire process.</p>
