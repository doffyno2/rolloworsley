<h2>What Are Bearings?</h2>
<p>Bearings are an essential part of any mechanical device. Bearings are used to reduce friction between two moving parts, and also to absorb shock. They are also used to transfer power and motion between two parts. Bearings are typically made from steel, and come in a variety of sizes and shapes. Common types of bearings include roller, ball, and needle bearings.</p>

<h2>Why Do Bearings Need To Be Cleaned?</h2>
<p>Bearings need to be cleaned to prevent dirt, dust, and other contaminants from building up on the surface of the bearing. This buildup can cause friction, which can reduce the efficiency of the bearing and cause it to wear out prematurely. Regular maintenance and cleaning of bearings can help to keep them functioning properly and extend their life.</p>

<h2>What Is Rubbing Alcohol?</h2>
<p>Rubbing alcohol is a type of chemical that is used for a variety of cleaning and sanitizing purposes. It is made up of isopropyl alcohol and water, and is available in different concentrations. Rubbing alcohol is often used to clean surfaces, as it can help to remove dirt, grime, and oils that can build up on surfaces over time.</p>

<h2>How To Clean Bearings With Rubbing Alcohol</h2>
<p>The process for cleaning bearings with rubbing alcohol is simple and straightforward. To begin, you will need to gather the following supplies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Rubbing alcohol</li>
  <li>Clean cloths</li>
  <li>Soft-bristled toothbrush</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have gathered the necessary supplies, you can begin the cleaning process. Begin by removing the bearing from its location. Make sure to wear protective gloves, as rubbing alcohol can be hazardous to the skin.</p>
<p>Once the bearing is removed, place it in a container that is large enough to hold the bearing and the rubbing alcohol. Then, pour enough rubbing alcohol into the container to cover the bearing. Allow the bearing to soak in the rubbing alcohol for several minutes.</p>
<p>After several minutes, remove the bearing from the rubbing alcohol and place it on a clean cloth. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub the bearing. This will help to remove any dirt or debris that may have built up on the surface of the bearing.</p>
<p>Once the bearing has been thoroughly scrubbed, rinse it off with clean water. Then, dry the bearing with a clean cloth. Make sure that the bearing is completely dry before reinstalling it in its original location.</p>
