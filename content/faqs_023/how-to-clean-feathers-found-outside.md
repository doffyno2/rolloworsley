<p>Feathers are delicate and beautiful, but when left outside and exposed to the elements, they can become dirty and difficult to clean. Fortunately, with the right techniques, you can restore the feathers to their original glory and make them look as good as new. In this article, we will examine the best ways to clean feathers found outside.</p>

<h2>Gather the Supplies</h2>

<p>Before you can begin cleaning the feathers, you will need to gather the supplies you will need to complete the task. For this project, you will need a soft-bristled brush, a bowl of warm water, a mild dish soap, a clean cloth, and a hairdryer.</p>

<h2>Remove any Dirt and Debris</h2>

<p>The first step in cleaning feathers found outside is to remove any dirt and debris from the feathers. Using a soft-bristled brush, gently brush away any dirt, leaves, twigs, or other debris from the feathers. Be sure to be gentle with the brush, as too much pressure can damage the delicate feathers.</p>

<h2>Soak the Feathers</h2>
