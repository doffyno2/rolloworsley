<p>If you own a 2012 Kia Optima and you’re having trouble with its fuel pump, then you’re likely having difficulty getting it to start. This isn’t an uncommon problem, but it can be a costly one to fix. Fortunately, though, if you have some basic automotive repair skills, you can replace the fuel pump yourself, saving you time and money.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials Needed</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you’ll need to make sure that you have the right tools and materials for the job. Here’s a quick list of what you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>New fuel pump</li>
  <li>Phillips head screwdriver</li>
  <li>Socket set</li>
  <li>Wrench</li>
  <li>Funnel</li>
  <li>Oil pan</li>
  <li>Drain pan</li>
  <li>Gasket scraper</li>
  <li>Rags</li>
  <li>Shop Vac</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step One: Preparing the Vehicle</h2>

<p>Before you begin replacing the fuel pump, you’ll need to prepare the vehicle. Start by disconnecting the negative battery cable. Then, raise the vehicle and support it with jack stands. Once the vehicle is secure, locate the fuel tank. It’s typically located on the underside of the vehicle, near the rear wheel.</p>

<h2>Step Two: Draining the Fuel Tank</h2>

<p>Once you’ve located the fuel tank, you’ll need to drain it. Place a drain pan beneath the tank, then loosen the fuel line connections. Once the connections are loose, you can remove the fuel line from the fuel pump. Once the fuel line is removed, the fuel should begin to drain from the fuel tank. When the fuel has finished draining, replace the fuel line.</p>

<h2>Step Three: Removing the Fuel Pump</h2>

<p>Now that the fuel has been drained, you can begin removing the fuel pump. Begin by removing the fuel tank cover. This is typically held on with a few Phillips head screws. Once the cover is removed, you’ll be able to access the fuel pump. Disconnect the electrical connection from the fuel pump, then remove the mounting bolts with a socket set. Finally, remove the fuel pump.</p>

<h2>Step Four: Installing the New Fuel Pump</h2>

<p>Once the old fuel pump has been removed, you can begin installing the new one. Start by installing the new fuel pump in the fuel tank. Be sure to use a new gasket to ensure a good seal. Once the new fuel pump is in place, reconnect the electrical connection, then tighten the mounting bolts with a wrench. Finally, replace the fuel tank cover.</p>

<h2>Step Five: Refilling the Fuel Tank</h2>

<p>Now that the new fuel pump is installed, you can begin refilling the fuel tank. Start by adding a few gallons of fuel to the tank, then check for leaks. If you don’t see any leaks, then you can add more fuel until the tank is full. Once the tank is full, you can reconnect the negative battery cable and start the vehicle.</p>
