How to Bypass Ignition Switch on Craftsman Riding Mower


Craftsman riding mowers are designed to provide years of dependable use, but like all machines, they require periodic maintenance and repairs. One common repair is the bypassing of an ignition switch. Depending on the age and model of the mower, there are different techniques that can be used to bypass the switch. In this article, we will discuss the steps required to bypass the ignition switch on a Craftsman riding mower.

<h2>What You Need to Know About Ignition Switches</h2>

An ignition switch is responsible for controlling the flow of electricity to the starter, allowing the engine to start when the key is turned. It also serves as a safety feature, preventing the engine from being started when the key is not inserted. Over time, the ignition switch can wear out, resulting in the need to be bypassed.

<h2>How to Bypass an Ignition Switch on a Craftsman Riding Mower</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Determine the Type of Ignition Switch</h3>

The first step in bypassing an ignition switch on a Craftsman riding mower is to determine the type of switch you have. The most common type of switch used on Craftsman mowers is the “push-to-start” type. This type of switch requires the user to push the starter button in order to start the engine.

<h3>Step 2: Disconnect the Wires</h3>

Once you have determined the type of switch you have, the next step is to disconnect the wires that are connected to the switch. On most Craftsman mowers, there will be two wires connected to the switch; a black wire and a white wire. Carefully remove the wires from the switch and set them aside.

<h3>Step 3: Connect the Wires to the Starter</h3>

Once the wires have been disconnected from the switch, the next step is to connect them to the starter. The black wire should be connected to the negative terminal on the starter, and the white wire should be connected to the positive terminal.

<h3>Step 4: Test the Starter</h3>

Once the wires have been connected to the starter, the next step is to test the starter to make sure it is working properly. Insert the key into the ignition and turn it to the “on” position. Push the starter button and the engine should start. If it does not start, recheck the connections and make sure all wires are securely connected.
