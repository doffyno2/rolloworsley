<p>The brake caliper is an important component of your car's braking system, securing the brake pads to the disc. The caliper is held together by bolts, which can become corroded and stuck over time. If you're unlucky enough to have a broken caliper bolt, you'll need to remove it so it can be replaced with a new one. Removing a broken caliper bolt is a tricky process that requires special tools, but it's a job you can do yourself if you have the right equipment.</p>

<h2>Tools You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you start, make sure you have the following tools on hand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brake caliper removal tool</li>
  <li>Socket wrench</li>
  <li>Allen wrench</li>
  <li>Hammer</li>
  <li>Punch</li>
  <li>Screwdriver</li>
  <li>Vice grips</li>
  <li>Pliers</li>
  <li>Wire brush</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps to Remove a Broken Caliper Bolt</h2>

<p>Once you've gathered all the tools you'll need, it's time to get started. Here's how to remove a broken caliper bolt:</p>

<h3>Step One: Raise the Vehicle</h3>

<p>Before you begin, raise your vehicle off the ground using a jack. Make sure the vehicle is securely placed on jack stands before you start working on it. Once the car is in the air, remove the wheel and tire to gain access to the caliper.</p>

<h3>Step Two: Clean the Area Around the Bolt</h3>

<p>Using a wire brush, clean any dirt and debris from around the broken caliper bolt. This will make it easier to see what you're doing and ensure the bolt is free of obstruction.</p>

<h3>Step Three: Loosen the Other Bolts</h3>

<p>Using an Allen wrench, loosen the other bolts that are securing the caliper to the disc. This will give you more room to work with the broken bolt.</p>

<h3>Step Four: Apply Heat to the Bolt</h3>

<p>Using a propane torch or a heat gun, apply heat to the broken caliper bolt. This will help to loosen the bolt, making it easier to remove.</p>

<h3>Step Five: Try to Remove the Bolt</h3>

<p>Once the bolt has been heated, use a socket wrench to try and remove it. If the bolt still won't budge, try using a vice grip or a punch to loosen it.</p>

<h3>Step Six: Remove the Broken Bolt</h3>

<p>Once the bolt has been loosened, use a hammer to carefully tap the broken bolt out of the caliper. Take care not to damage the caliper or the disc during this process.</p>

<h3>Step Seven: Clean the Area</h3>

<p>Now that the broken bolt has been removed, use a wire brush to clean the area. This will ensure that the new bolt will fit properly.</p>

<h3>Step Eight: Insert the New Bolt</h3>

<p>Once the area is clean, insert the new caliper bolt and use a socket wrench to tighten it. Make sure the bolt is tightened securely before moving on to the next step.</p>

<h3>Step Nine: Re-assemble the Parts</h3>

<p>Once the new bolt is in place, re-assemble the parts. Use a socket wrench to tighten the other bolts, then replace the wheel and tire. Lower the car off the jack stands and you're done!</p>
