<p>Razor scooters are a great way to get around, and they're relatively simple to use. However, you may find yourself wondering how to close a Razor scooter. Don't worry - it's a simple process and only takes a few steps.</p>

<h2>Step One: Find the Folding Mechanism</h2>

<p>Most Razor scooters have a folding mechanism that allows you to quickly and easily fold the scooter for storage or transport. The folding mechanism is usually located on the handlebars, and it consists of two levers. One lever is used to unlock the folding mechanism, and the other is used to actually fold the scooter.</p>
