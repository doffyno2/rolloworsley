<p>Madden 15 is the latest installment in the popular video game franchise, Madden NFL. The game is based on the National Football League (NFL) and allows players to simulate the experience of playing in the NFL. One of the key elements of the game is the ability to hike the ball. Hiking the ball is the process of transferring the ball from the center to the quarterback and is an essential part of the game.</p>

<h2>What is Hiking the Ball?</h2>

<p>Hiking the ball is the process of transferring the ball from the center to the quarterback. It is the first step in a play and is essential for the offense to be successful. The center snaps the ball to the quarterback who then must hike it to the other players in order to begin a play. It is important that the quarterback hikes the ball correctly in order for the play to be successful.</p>

<h2>How to Hike the Ball in Madden 15</h2>

<p>Hiking the ball in Madden 15 is relatively easy. The first step is to line the center up correctly. This means that the center should be lined up directly in front of the quarterback with their feet planted firmly on the ground. The center should also be lined up so that their shoulder pads are directly in line with the quarterback’s shoulder pads. This will help ensure that the ball is snapped directly to the quarterback.</p>

<p>Once the center is properly lined up, the quarterback should be ready to receive the ball. The quarterback should be standing with his feet shoulder-width apart and his hands in a ready position. He should also be looking downfield in order to be able to read the defense and make any necessary adjustments to the play. Once the center has snapped the ball, the quarterback should be able to quickly hike the ball to a receiver or running back.</p>

<h2>Tips for Hiking the Ball</h2>

<p>When hiking the ball, it is important to make sure that the ball is snapped correctly. The ball should be snapped directly to the quarterback and should not be thrown or bounced. Additionally, the ball should be snapped with enough force that it reaches the quarterback quickly. If the ball is snapped too slowly, it could give the defense time to react before the play begins.</p>

<p>It is also important for the quarterback to make sure that he is ready to receive the ball. The quarterback should be in a ready stance with his hands in a ready position and his feet firmly planted on the ground. If he is not ready, he could drop the ball or make a bad pass. Additionally, the quarterback should be looking downfield in order to be able to read the defense and make any necessary adjustments to the play.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Hiking the ball in Madden 15 is an important part of the game and can be a difficult task. It is important for the center to line up correctly and for the quarterback to be in a ready stance with his hands in a ready position.
