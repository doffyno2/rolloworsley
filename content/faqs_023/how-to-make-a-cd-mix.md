<p>Making a CD mix is an art form that has been around for decades. It’s an incredibly fun, creative way to express your musical preferences to friends or family. Making a CD mix is a great way to show someone you care, or to give a personalized gift. It may take some practice, but once you get the hang of it, you can make a great mix that’s sure to be a hit.</p>

<h2>Gather Your Music</h2>

<p>The first step to making a CD mix is to gather all of your music. Dig out all of your CDs, MP3s, and other musical media that you want to include on your mix. Once you have everything together, organize your music by artist, genre, or any other criteria you want. This will make it easier to pick and choose which tracks you want to include.</p>

<h2>Choose Your Tracks</h2>

<p>Once you have your music organized, it’s time to pick the tracks you want to include on your mix. Try to pick songs that have a common theme or sound to them, or songs that you think the recipient will enjoy. Make sure to leave some space on your mix for a few “surprise” tracks that you think the recipient will really like. </p>

<h2>Put Your Mix Together</h2>

<p>Now it’s time to put your mix together. Start by inserting a blank CD into your CD burner. Follow the instructions on your computer to create a new audio CD. Once the CD is ready, you can start adding the tracks you want to include on your mix. Drag and drop the tracks onto the CD in the order you want them to appear. Make sure to leave some room at the end of the CD for a few surprise tracks.</p>

<h2>Burn Your Mix</h2>

<p>When you’ve finished adding all of the tracks to your mix, it’s time to burn it. Follow the instructions on your computer to burn the audio CD. Once the CD is finished burning, remove it from the drive and label it with the recipient’s name. Your mix is now ready to be given as a gift!</p>
