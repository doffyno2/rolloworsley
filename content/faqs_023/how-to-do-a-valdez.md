The Valdez is a popular figure skating move that requires precision and accuracy. It is a difficult move to master, but with practice and dedication, it can be done! In this article, we will discuss the steps necessary to properly execute the Valdez.

<h2>What is the Valdez?</h2>

The Valdez is a figure skating jump that requires a skater to take off from a back inside edge, land on a back outside edge, and take off from a back inside edge again. It is named after the Spanish skater, Javier Fernandez Valdez.

<h2>What are the Requirements for the Valdez?</h2>

The Valdez requires a skater to have excellent balance and control, as well as flexibility and strength. A skater must also have a strong skating technique and be able to accurately judge the distance between the take-off and landing points.

<h2>How to Execute the Valdez</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Prepare for the Take-Off</h3>

Before attempting the Valdez, the skater must prepare for the take-off. The skater should be in a crouched position, with the head and torso upright and the arms stretched out in front. The skater should then shift the body weight onto the back inside edge of the skate, making sure that the back outside edge is off the ice.

<h3>Step 2: Take-Off</h3>

When the skater is ready, they should take off from the back inside edge of the skate. The skater should push off with a strong jump and make sure that the body is in an upright position. The skater should also make sure to bring their arms up and back to help with the rotation of the jump.

<h3>Step 3: Rotate</h3>

Once the skater has taken off, they should begin to rotate their body. The rotation should be done quickly and accurately, with the skater focusing on keeping their arms and legs in the proper position throughout the rotation. The rotation should finish when the skater reaches the peak of the jump.

<h3>Step 4: Landing</h3>

When the skater has completed the rotation, they should begin to prepare for the landing. The skater should make sure that the back outside edge of the skate is on the ice first, and then gradually shift the weight onto the edge. The skater should also make sure to keep their arms and legs in the proper position and keep the head and torso upright.

<h3>Step 5: Finishing the Jump</h3>

Once the skater has landed on the back outside edge, they should finish the jump by pushing off with a strong jump and rotating their body in the opposite direction. This will help the skater to complete the jump and land back on the back inside edge of the skate.

<h2>Tips for Executing the Valdez</h2>

<h3>Practice</h3>

The best way to perfect the Valdez is to practice it regularly. Practicing the jump in slow motion and gradually increasing the speed can help the skater become more comfortable with the jump.

<h3>Focus on Form</h3>

When executing the Valdez, it is important to focus on form. The skater should make sure to keep the body in an upright position, keep the arms and legs in the proper position, and make sure to keep the head and torso upright.

<h3>Stay Relaxed</h3>

It is important to stay relaxed when attempting the Valdez. Tensing up during the jump can make it more difficult to execute the move properly. Staying relaxed will help the skater maintain balance and control throughout the jump.
