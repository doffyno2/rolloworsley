How to Remove Stripped Hex Screw

One of the most frustrating problems you can encounter when doing simple repair work or building something is dealing with a stripped hex screw. This occurs when the head of the screw is rounded off from over-tightening with a screwdriver, making it impossible to remove with a standard driver. This problem can be incredibly annoying and can leave you feeling completely helpless, but in reality, there are several ways that you can remove a stripped hex screw. In this article, we’ll walk you through the process so you can get back to work quickly and easily.



A hex screw is a type of screw that has a hexagonal head, which is used to drive the screw into a material. This type of screw is often used in construction and repairs, as it is very secure and can be tightened with a screwdriver. The problem with hex screws is that they can be tightened too tightly, which can cause the head of the screw to become rounded off, or “stripped”. This makes it impossible to remove with a standard driver.



Stripped hex screws usually occur when the screw is over-tightened with a screwdriver. This can cause the head of the screw to become rounded off, which prevents the screw from being removed with a standard driver. It is important to be aware of the danger of over-tightening screws, as it can damage the head of the screw, making it impossible to remove.



When attempting to remove a stripped hex screw, it is important to have the right tools and materials on hand. Here is a list of the items you will need:

• Screwdriver
• Hex wrench
• Hammer
• Needle-nose pliers
• Utility knife
• Stripped screw extractor
• Penetrating oil



Once you have all the necessary tools and materials, you can begin the process of removing the stripped hex screw. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you do so:

<h2>Step 1: Apply Penetrating Oil</h2>

The first step is to apply some penetrating oil to the head of the screw. This will help to loosen the screw and make it easier to remove. Apply the oil and then wait a few minutes for it to take effect.

<h2>Step 2: Use a Hex Wrench</h2>

Once the oil has had a chance to penetrate the head of the screw, you can attempt to remove it with a hex wrench. Insert the hex wrench into the head of the screw and try to turn it counter-clockwise. If the screw is still too tight, you can move on to the next step.

<h2>Step 3: Use a Hammer and Pliers</h2>

If the hex wrench does not work, you can try using a hammer and a pair of needle-nose pliers. Place the pliers around the head of the screw and then tap the pliers with a hammer. This will help to loosen the screw and make it easier to remove.

<h2>Step 4: Use a Stripped Screw Extractor</h2>

If the hammer and pliers method does not work, you can try using a stripped screw extractor. This tool is designed to remove stripped screws and can be purchased from most hardware stores. Insert the extractor into the head of the screw and then turn it counter-clockwise until the screw is removed.

<h2>Step 5: Use a Utility Knife</h2>

If the screw is still not coming out, you can try using a utility knife. Carefully insert the blade of the knife into the head of the screw and then twist it counter-clockwise until the screw is loosened. Be sure to exercise caution when using a utility knife, as it can be dangerous.
