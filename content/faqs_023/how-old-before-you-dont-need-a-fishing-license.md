<h2>Introduction to Fishing Licenses</h2>

<p>A fishing license is a permit issued by a governmental agency that allows an individual to legally fish in a designated area. Each state has its own regulations and policies when it comes to fishing licenses, as well as the required age for obtaining one. Depending on the state, individuals must be at least 16 or 18 years old in order to purchase a fishing license. In some cases, individuals may be able to obtain a fishing license at a younger age if they have a valid form of identification.</p>
