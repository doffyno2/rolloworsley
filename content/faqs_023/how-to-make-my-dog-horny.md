It’s no secret that dogs are highly sexual creatures, and they can experience strong sexual urges and desires just like humans can. If your dog is displaying signs of sexual frustration, it’s important to address the issue and find ways to satisfy their needs. Here, we’ll talk about how to make your dog horny and give them the attention they need.

<h2>Why Is My Dog Horny?</h2>

There are a few reasons why your dog might be particularly horny.

<ul>
<li>Your dog is in heat. Female dogs go through a heat cycle every six to eight months, during which they are especially hormonal and sexually aroused. This can last anywhere from three weeks to a month. </li>

<h2>How to Make Your Dog Horny</h2>
