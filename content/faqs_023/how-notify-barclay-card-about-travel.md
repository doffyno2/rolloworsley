Traveling can be a lot of fun, but it can also be stressful. One of the most important things to do before you go on a trip is to let your credit card issuer know that you will be away. This will ensure that your account is not flagged as suspicious when you use your card while you are away. Barclaycard is one of the most popular credit card issuers in the world, and they have a few different ways to let them know that you will be traveling. 

<h2>Why Should You Notify Barclay Card Before Traveling?</h2>

Notifying Barclaycard before you travel is important for a few reasons. First, it can help prevent your cards from being blocked when you use them in a different country or location. If you forget to notify them and then suddenly use your card in a different place, it can look suspicious and your card may be blocked. Notifying them in advance lets them know that the activity is legitimate and will help to prevent any inconvenience. 

Another reason why it is important to notify BarclayCard before you travel is to ensure that you will have access to your account in case of an emergency. You may need to use your card to make an emergency purchase or withdrawal, and if your account has been blocked due to suspicious activity, you may not be able to do this. 

<h2>How to Notify Barclay Card Before Traveling</h2>

The easiest way is to use the Barclaycard mobile app. This app allows you to quickly and easily notify Barclaycard of your upcoming travel plans.

Once you submit the notification, it will be sent to BarclayCard and they will be able to make sure that your account is not flagged for suspicious activity.

If you don’t have the mobile app, you can also call BarclayCard customer service to notify them of your travel plans. You will need to provide them with the details of your trip, including the dates and locations you will be visiting. Once you provide them with this information, they will be able to make sure that your account is not flagged for suspicious activity. 

<h2>What Else Can You Do to Prepare for Travel?</h2>

In addition to notifying BarclayCard of your travel plans, there are a few other things that you should do to prepare for your trip.
