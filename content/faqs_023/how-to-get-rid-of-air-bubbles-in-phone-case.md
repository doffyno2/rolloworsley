This will also cause the air to expand, making it easier to get rid of the bubble.</p>

<h2>How to Avoid Air Bubbles in the Future</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid air bubbles in the future is to make sure that your phone and case fit together properly. As mentioned earlier, if the case is too tight or the phone is too small for the case, this can cause the phone to move around and create tension. Therefore, it's important to select a phone case that fits your phone perfectly.</p>
