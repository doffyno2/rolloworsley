<p>Christmas is a special time of year, and it is a great opportunity to show off your craftsmanship and creativity with some DIY decorations. One of the most beautiful decorations you can make is the cathedral window Christmas ornament ball. This craft is easy to make and requires just a few simple materials. With this guide, you can learn how to make your own cathedral window Christmas ornament balls to display in your home and give as gifts.</p>

<h2>Materials Needed</h2>

<p>Before you can begin making your cathedral window Christmas ornament balls, you will need to gather the necessary materials. This craft requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fabric scraps</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
<li>Embroidery thread</li>
<li>Needle</li>
<li>Plastic ornament balls</li>
<li>Ribbon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Cut Fabric</h2>

<p>Start by cutting your fabric into small rectangles. The size of each rectangle will depend on the size of your plastic ball, so you may want to measure it before cutting. Generally, the rectangles should be about two inches by four inches. You will need about 24 pieces for each ball.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Sew Rectangles Together</h2>

<p>Once you have cut all of your rectangles, you can begin sewing them together. Take two rectangles and place them together with the right sides facing each other. Then, use a needle and thread to sew the two pieces together along the edges. Repeat this process until all of your rectangles are sewn together.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Sew Rectangles into a Circle</h2>

<p>Once all of your rectangles are sewn together, sew the ends of the rectangles together to form a circle. Make sure to leave an opening at the top of the circle. This will allow you to slide the plastic ball in later.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Slide Ball into Fabric</h2>

<p>Now that your fabric is sewn into a circle, you can slide the plastic ball inside. Make sure that the ball is centered in the middle of the circle. Once it is in place, tie a piece of thread around the opening to secure the ball.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Sew Window Shapes</h2>

<p>Now that the ball is in place, you can begin sewing the window shapes. Take a piece of thread and tie a knot in one end. Insert the needle into the fabric and pull it through. Then, move the needle a few inches away and insert it into the fabric again. Pull the thread through and repeat this process all the way around the circle. This will create the window shapes.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Tie Off Thread</h2>

<p>When all of the window shapes are sewn, tie off the thread at the end. Trim any excess thread and then tie a piece of ribbon to the top of the ornament. This will make it easy to hang the ornament on a tree or in a window.</p>
