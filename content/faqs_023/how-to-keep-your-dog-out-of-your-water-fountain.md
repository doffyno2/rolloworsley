<p>Your water fountain is a beautiful addition to your garden and a great source of refreshment for you and your family. But when your pet dog decides to jump in and get a drink, it can be not only annoying but dangerous for the fountain. Learning how to keep your dog out of your water fountain is essential for maintaining its beauty and safety. Here are some tips on how to keep your furry friend from ruining your water feature.</p>

<h2>Train Your Dog to Stay Away from the Water Fountain</h2>

<p>The best way to keep your dog from getting into the water fountain is to train him from an early age. Start by teaching your puppy basic commands like “sit” and “stay.” As your dog gets older, you can start teaching him to stay away from the fountain. Use treats and positive reinforcement to reward him for good behavior. Remember to never use physical punishment as it can lead to fear-based behaviors.</p>

<h2>Install a Barrier Around the Fountain</h2>

<p>If your dog is already used to jumping in the fountain, then it’s time to install a physical barrier. You can use a fence or gate to keep your pup from getting into the fountain. Make sure the barrier is tall enough and strong enough to keep your dog out. For extra security, you can also add a latch or lock to the gate.</p>

<h2>Cover the Fountain with a Net or Mesh</h2>

<p>If you don’t want to install a barrier around the fountain, then you can cover it with a net or mesh. This is a great way to keep your pup from getting in without blocking off the fountain. Make sure the net is strong enough to hold your dog’s weight and that it doesn’t have any gaps or holes where he can get in.</p>

<h2>Distract Your Dog with Toys and Treats</h2>

<p>If your pup is getting too close to the fountain, then try to distract him with toys and treats. Offer him a treat or toy as soon as he gets close to the fountain and praise him when he stays away. This will help him understand that he should stay away from the fountain.</p>

<h2>Provide an Alternative Source of Water for Your Dog</h2>

<p>If your dog is always trying to get into the fountain, then it could be because he’s thirsty. Make sure to provide him with an alternative source of water such as a large bowl or a kiddie pool. This will ensure that he has enough water while keeping him away from the fountain.</p>

<h2>Use Repellents to Keep Your Dog Away</h2>

<p>If all else fails, then you can always use repellents to keep your pup away from the fountain.
