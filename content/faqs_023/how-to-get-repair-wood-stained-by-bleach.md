Bleach can be a great way to whiten and brighten wood surfaces, but it can also cause irreparable damage if not used properly. Wood stained by bleach can be difficult to repair, but it is possible. In this article, we'll discuss the steps you need to take to properly repair wood stained by bleach and restore it to its former glory.

<h2>What Causes Wood to Become Stained By Bleach?</h2>

When bleach comes into contact with wood, it can cause discoloration and staining. This is because bleach is an oxidizer, meaning that it removes electrons from the wood and causes it to become less able to accept dye or stain. Additionally, bleach is highly corrosive and can cause wood to become brittle and weak.

<h2>What Steps Are Needed to Repair Wood Stained By Bleach?</h2>

Repairing wood stained by bleach involves several steps. The first step is to clean the wood. Use a soft brush and soapy water to remove any dirt or dust from the surface of the wood. Next, use a cloth soaked in bleach to clean the wood. This will help to remove any of the discoloration caused by the bleach.

Once the wood is clean, you can begin to repair the damage caused by the bleach. Start by sanding the wood using a medium-grit sandpaper. This will help to remove any remaining discoloration. Then, apply a wood stain or dye to the wood in order to restore its original color. 

Finally, you should seal the wood with a clear coat of polyurethane or varnish. This will help to protect the wood from further damage and keep it looking its best.
