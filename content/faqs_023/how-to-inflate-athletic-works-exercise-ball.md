<h2>What You'll Need to Inflate an Athletic Works Exercise Ball</h2>

<p>Inflating your Athletic Works exercise ball isn't complicated, but you will need the following items:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A hand or electric pump</li>
    <li>A specially designed needle</li>
    <li>An Athletic Works exercise ball</li>
</ul>

<p>You can purchase all of these items separately, or you can purchase an inflatable exercise ball kit which includes all of the necessary items.</p>

<h2>Step by Step Guide to Inflating an Athletic Works Exercise Ball</h2>

<p>Inflating an Athletic Works exercise ball is a simple process, but it is important that you follow the steps carefully to ensure that the ball is inflated correctly and safely. Here are the steps you should follow:</p>

<h3>1. Prepare the Ball</h3>

<p>Before you start to inflate the ball, you should prepare it by making sure it is clean and free from any debris. You should also check that there are no rips or tears in the ball, as this could lead to a puncture when you are inflating it.</p>

<h3>2. Insert the Needle into the Ball</h3>

<p>Once you have prepared the ball, you need to insert the specially designed needle into the ball. This can be a little tricky, so make sure you take your time and do it carefully. Once the needle is inserted, you can start to inflate the ball.</p>

<h3>3. Inflate the Ball</h3>

<p>Now you are ready to start inflating the ball. You can either use a hand or electric pump, depending on your preference. Make sure the pump is firmly attached to the needle before you start inflating the ball. As you inflate the ball, make sure you check the pressure regularly so that you don't over-inflate it.</p>

<h3>4. Remove the Needle and Check the Pressure</h3>

<p>Once the ball is inflated, you can remove the needle from the ball. You should then check the pressure of the ball by pressing on it with your hand. If the ball feels firm but still has a little give, then it is inflated correctly.</p>

<h3>5. Secure the Ball</h3>

<p>Finally, you should secure the ball to make sure it doesn't move around during use. You can do this by using a specially designed tether, which is usually included in the inflatable exercise ball kit.</p>
