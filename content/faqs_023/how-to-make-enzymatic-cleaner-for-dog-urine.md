<h2>What is an Enzymatic Cleaner?</h2>

An enzymatic cleaner is a type of cleaning product specifically designed to break down organic matter, such as urine, feces, vomit, and even blood. The enzymes in these cleaners break down these organic materials into simpler, less smelly forms. As such, enzymatic cleaners are a great choice for cleaning up after pets, especially dogs.

<h2>Why Use an Enzymatic Cleaner?</h2>

Enzymatic cleaners are a great choice for pet messes because they are specifically designed to break down the organic material. Regular household cleaners can sometimes just mask the odors, or even make the smell worse. Enzymatic cleaners, on the other hand, actually break down the organics, eliminating the source of the odor.

Enzymatic cleaners are also much safer for use around pets. Regular household cleaners often contain harsh chemicals that can be toxic to pets. Enzymatic cleaners, however, are much gentler and safer.

<h2>What Ingredients Do You Need to Make an Enzymatic Cleaner?</h2>

Making an enzymatic cleaner is surprisingly easy and only requires a few simple ingredients. The basic ingredients are a mild detergent, hydrogen peroxide, white vinegar, and baking soda.

The mild detergent can be any type of dish soap or laundry detergent. It is important to use a mild detergent so that it does not irritate your pet's skin or eyes.

Hydrogen peroxide is a natural disinfectant and deodorizer. It is also a great way to break down organic materials.

White vinegar is acidic and can help to break down organic materials as well. It is also a great way to neutralize odors.

Baking soda is a great way to absorb odors and can help to break down organic materials as well.

<h2>Instructions for Making an Enzymatic Cleaner</h2>

Making an enzymatic cleaner is easy and only requires a few simple steps. 

Start by combining one cup of mild detergent with one cup of hydrogen peroxide in a bowl. Mix the ingredients together until they are fully combined.

Next, add one cup of white vinegar and one cup of baking soda to the mixture. Stir the ingredients together until they are fully combined.

Once the ingredients are fully combined, transfer the mixture to a spray bottle. Spray the enzymatic cleaner on the affected area and let it sit for 10 minutes.

After 10 minutes, wipe the area with a damp cloth to remove any residue.

<h2>Tips and Warnings for Using an Enzymatic Cleaner</h2>

When using an enzymatic cleaner, it is important to remember that it is specifically designed for organic materials, such as dog urine and feces. As such, it should not be used on fabrics, carpets, or other non-organic materials.

It is also important to remember that enzymatic cleaners should not be used on freshly soiled areas. The enzymes need time to break down the organics and will not be effective if used too soon.

Finally, it is important to remember that while enzymatic cleaners are effective at breaking down organics, they do not disinfect or sanitize surfaces. As such, it is important to use a separate disinfectant after using an enzymatic cleaner.
