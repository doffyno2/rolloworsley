<p>Butterfly anchors are designed to be used in light duty applications such as hanging light fixtures, picture frames, and other lightweight objects. They are easily inserted into drywall and can provide a secure hold for those items. Unfortunately, they can sometimes be difficult to remove when you no longer need them. This article will explain the best ways to remove a butterfly anchor from drywall.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Use a Screwdriver</h2>

<p>The easiest way to remove a butterfly anchor is to use a flat-head screwdriver. Insert the tip of the screwdriver into the center of the anchor and turn it clockwise. This should cause the anchor to loosen up and come out of the wall. If the anchor is particularly stubborn, you may need to use more force to loosen it. Be careful not to apply too much force, as you don’t want to damage the wall.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Use Pliers</h2>

<p>If the screwdriver method doesn’t work, you can try using pliers. Place the pliers over the butterfly anchor and squeeze. This should help to loosen the anchor and make it easier to remove. Be sure to use a pair of pliers that has a good grip, as you don’t want them to slip off during the process.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Use a Hammer</h2>

<p>If the pliers method doesn’t work, you can try using a hammer. Place the hammer over the butterfly anchor and tap the handle gently with another hammer. This should cause the anchor to loosen and come out of the wall. Again, be careful not to apply too much force as you don’t want to damage the wall.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Use a Drill</h2>

<p>If the other methods don’t work, you can try using a drill. Insert a drill bit into the center of the butterfly anchor and drill it out. This should cause the anchor to loosen and come out of the wall. Be sure to use a drill bit that is appropriate for the size of the anchor.</p>
