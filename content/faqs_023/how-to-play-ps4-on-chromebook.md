Chromebooks have become increasingly popular over the past few years, as they’re lightweight, user-friendly, and relatively affordable. But one of the biggest knocks against them is that they can’t play games. That’s not necessarily true anymore, as it’s now possible to play PS4 games on a Chromebook.

<h2>What You Need to Play PS4 Games on Chromebook</h2>

Before you can start playing PS4 games on your Chromebook, you’ll need to make sure you have the right equipment. First, you’ll need a Chromebook that supports Google Play.
