Eating out with friends, family, or even strangers can be a challenge when you are a loud chewer. No one wants to be the person whose chewing noises drown out the conversation or embarrasses the table. Fortunately, there are a few simple, easy-to-follow steps that can help you learn to chew food quietly.

<h2>What Causes Loud Chewing?</h2>

Chewing loudly is often caused by poor oral hygiene. If you have food particles stuck between your teeth, you will likely make more noise when you chew. Additionally, having misaligned or overcrowded teeth can also increase the amount of noise generated when you chew. 

<h2>Tips for Chewing Quietly</h2>

<h3>Chew Slowly</h3>

One of the simplest ways to reduce noise when you chew is to slow down. Taking your time to chew and break down your food into smaller pieces can help to reduce the sound that your teeth make when they come into contact with the food. 

<h3>Chew with Your Mouth Closed</h3>

Another way to reduce the noise from your chewing is to keep your mouth closed. This will help to muffle the sound of your teeth coming into contact with the food. Additionally, chewing with your mouth closed helps to reduce the chances of food particles flying out of your mouth and onto the table. 

<h3>Chew Soft Foods</h3>

Choosing softer foods to eat can also help to reduce the noise that you make when you chew. Foods such as mashed potatoes, oatmeal, and yogurts are all much quieter to chew than crunchy foods like apples and celery. 

<h3>Keep Your Teeth Clean</h3>

Finally, keeping your teeth clean is one of the most important things that you can do to reduce the noise of your chewing. Regularly brushing and flossing your teeth will help to remove food particles that can cause loud chewing noises. Additionally, visiting your dentist for regular cleanings can help to keep your teeth in top shape and reduce noise when you chew.
