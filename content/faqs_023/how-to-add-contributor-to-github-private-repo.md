<p>When it comes to developing software, collaboration is essential. That’s why GitHub offers a variety of features to help developers collaborate on projects. One of those features is the ability to add contributors to a private repository. This allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project without making the code public. In this article, we’ll show you how to add contributors to a GitHub private repository.</p>

<h2>What is a GitHub Private Repository?</h2>

<p>A GitHub private repository is a repository that is only visible to the owner and any collaborators they add. This allows developers to work together on a project without worrying about unwanted eyes seeing their work. It also makes it easier to control who has access to the code, which is essential for security.</p>

<h2>How to Add Contributors to a GitHub Private Repo</h2>

<p>Adding contributors to a GitHub private repository is a simple process. Here’s how to do it:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Log into GitHub</h3>

<p>The first step is to log into your GitHub account. Once you’re logged in, navigate to the repository you want to add contributors to.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Click “Settings”</h3>

<p>Once you’re in the repository, click the “Settings” tab. This will open a page with various settings for the repository.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Click “Collaborators”</h3>

<p>On the left side of the page, you’ll see a list of options. Click the “Collaborators” option. This will open a page with a list of all the contributors who have been added to the repository.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Add a Collaborator</h3>

<p>To add a new collaborator, simply type their username or email address in the “Add Collaborator” box and click “Add Collaborator”. This will add the user to the list of collaborators on the repository.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Set Permissions</h3>

<p>Once the user has been added, you’ll need to set their permissions. By default, collaborators are given “Write” access, which allows them to make changes to the repository. However, you can also set their permissions to “Read” or “Admin”. To do this, simply click the dropdown menu next to the user’s name and select the desired permission level.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Save Changes</h3>

<p>Once you’ve set the permissions for the user, be sure to click the “Save Changes” button at the bottom of the page. This will save the changes and the user will now be able to collaborate on the repository.</p>
