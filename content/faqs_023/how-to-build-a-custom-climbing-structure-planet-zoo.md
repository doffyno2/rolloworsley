Climbing structures in Planet Zoo have become increasingly popular in recent years. They provide a fun and exciting way for players to explore their zoo and interact with the animals. Building a custom climbing structure, however, can be a daunting task. There are a lot of things to consider, from the type of material to use, to the size, to the safety features. In this article, we'll cover all the basics to help you create the perfect climbing structure for your Planet Zoo.

<h2>Types of Materials To Use</h2>

When building a custom climbing structure, the first step is to decide on the type of material to use. Wood is a popular choice, as it is easy to work with and relatively inexpensive. However, it is not as durable as other materials like metal or plastic. It is also susceptible to weather damage and rot.

Metal is a much more durable option, but it is also much more expensive. It is also more difficult to work with, and it can be noisy when in use. Plastic is a good option for lighter structures, as it is lightweight and easy to work with. It is also relatively inexpensive and can be easily customized with paint or other decorations.

<h2>Size and Shape</h2>

The next step is to decide on the size and shape of your custom climbing structure. The size will depend on the size of the area you have to work with. It is important to consider the weight of the structure, as well as the size of the animals that will be using it. You should also consider the number of animals that will be using the structure, as this will affect the size.

The shape of the structure is also important. Climbing structures should be designed to be as safe and secure as possible. The shape should be designed to minimize the risk of falls or injuries. It should also be designed with the animals in mind, so that they can easily climb and maneuver around the structure.

<h2>Safety Features</h2>

Safety is an important consideration when building a custom climbing structure. The structure should be designed to minimize the risk of falls or injuries. This includes ensuring that the structure is stable and secure, and that all of the pieces are firmly attached. The structure should also have handrails or other safety features to help reduce the risk of falls.

<h2>Installing the Structure</h2>

Once you have decided on the materials, size, and shape of your custom climbing structure, you can begin to install it. The installation process will depend on the type of material you are using. Wood structures will need to be secured to the ground using stakes or anchors. Metal and plastic structures may need to be attached to a frame or other structure.

<h2>Maintenance and Upkeep</h2>

Once your custom climbing structure is installed, it is important to maintain and upkeep it. Regularly inspect the structure for any signs of wear or damage, and make repairs as needed. It is also important to keep the structure clean and free of debris, as this can create a hazardous situation for the animals.
