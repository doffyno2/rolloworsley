<p>Mirrors are delicate and beautiful pieces of décor that can enhance any home. Unfortunately, they are also prone to getting scratched or damaged. Scratches in mirrors can look unsightly, but they don’t have to be permanent. If you find yourself faced with a scratched mirror, don’t despair – you can easily repair the damage yourself with a few simple tools and materials.</p>

<h2>What You Will Need to Repair a Scratched Mirror</h2>

<p>The materials you will need to repair a scratched mirror are simple and inexpensive. You will need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A clean cloth</li>
  <li>Rubbing alcohol</li>
  <li>Glass repair compound</li>
  <li>Fine-grit sandpaper</li>
  <li>A soft-bristled brush</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Clean the Mirror</h2>

<p>Before you begin the repair process, it is important to make sure you are working with a clean surface. Use a clean cloth and rubbing alcohol to wipe the mirror, removing any dirt and dust. This will help ensure that the repair compound will stick to the mirror properly.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Sand the Damaged Area</h2>

<p>Once you have a clean surface, you can begin to repair the damage. Use the sandpaper to gently sand the scratched area. This will help the repair compound stick to the mirror and fill the scratches. Be sure to use a fine-grit sandpaper, as coarser sandpaper can cause further damage to the mirror.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply the Repair Compound</h2>

<p>Once the area is sanded, you can apply the glass repair compound. Apply a thin layer of the compound to the scratched area, and use the soft-bristled brush to smooth it out. Allow the compound to dry for several hours before you move on to the next step.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Sand the Area Again</h2>

<p>Once the repair compound is dry, you will need to sand the area again. This will help blend the repaired area in with the rest of the mirror. Again, use a fine-grit sandpaper for this step. When you are finished, you should have a smooth and uniform surface.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Clean the Mirror Again</h2>

<p>The final step in the repair process is to clean the area one more time. Use the cloth and alcohol to remove any remaining dust or debris from the repaired area. This will help ensure that the repaired area looks seamless and unnoticeable.</p>
