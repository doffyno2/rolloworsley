<p>Are you a fan of the Sims 4 and want your furry friends to get along? Then you’ve come to the right place! We’ll provide you with some helpful tips on how to make your Sims’ canine companions get along and even become friends.</p>

<p>It’s no secret that dogs don’t always get along, especially if they’re from different breeds. But with a little bit of work, you can get your Sims’ canine companions to get along and even become friends. This guide will provide you with some helpful tips on how to make your Sims’ canine companions get along and even become friends.</p>

<h2>Introduce Your Pets Gradually</h2>

<p>When introducing two dogs from different households, it’s best to do it slowly and cautiously. Start by having one of the dogs in the house and the other in a separate room, then gradually move them closer together. Make sure to supervise them at all times and to reward them with treats when they behave appropriately.</p>

<p>You can also introduce them slowly by having one dog in a different room and the other outside, then slowly move them closer together until they can interact. Again, make sure to supervise them and reward them when they behave appropriately.</p>

<h2>Let Your Dogs Play Together</h2>

<p>Once your dogs are comfortable with each other, you can let them play together. Encourage them to play with toys, wrestle, or just run around the house together. Let them explore the house together and become familiar with each other’s scents. This will help them become comfortable and build a bond.</p>

<h2>Train Your Dogs Together</h2>

<p>Training your dogs together is a great way to get them to bond. If you have the same type of dog, you can teach them the same commands and reward them when they obey. If you have different breeds of dogs, you can still train them together, just make sure to use different commands for each breed.</p>

<p>Training your dogs together can also help them learn to respect each other’s space. Make sure to reward them when they obey commands and pay attention to each other’s behavior. This will help them understand that they need to respect each other’s space.</p>

<h2>Provide Separate Space for Your Dogs</h2>

<p>It’s important to provide each dog with their own space in the house. This will help them feel secure and give them a place to retreat when they need some alone time. You can provide each dog with their own bed, crate, or designated area in the house.</p>

<h2>Provide Equal Attention to Both Dogs</h2>

<p>It’s important to give both dogs the same amount of attention. If one dog gets more attention than the other, it can lead to jealousy and cause tension between the two. Make sure to give both dogs equal attention and reward them when they behave appropriately.</p>

<h2>Give Them Time Apart</h2>

<p>It’s also important to give your dogs some time apart. This will help them miss each other and appreciate their time together more. You can give them separate playtime or walks, or just let them explore the house on their own. This will help them stay connected and build a stronger bond.</p>
