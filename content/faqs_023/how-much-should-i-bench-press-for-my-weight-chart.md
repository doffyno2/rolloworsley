<h2>Factors that Affect Your Bench Press Weight</h2>

Although the weight chart above provides a good guideline for determining an appropriate amount of weight for your bench press, there are several other factors that can affect how much weight you can lift. These include: 

<h3>Age</h3>

Age is one of the main factors that will affect your bench press weight. As you get older, your muscles naturally become weaker, making it more difficult to lift heavy weights. Younger individuals tend to have a higher bench press weight than older individuals. 

<h3>Training Experience</h3>

The amount of training experience you have is also a major factor in determining your bench press weight. Individuals who have been training for a longer period of time have usually built up more strength and muscle size than those who have only been training for a short period of time. 

<h3>Body Type</h3>

Your body type is also an important factor in determining your bench press weight. Individuals with longer limbs tend to be able to lift more weight than those with shorter limbs due to their increased leverage.
