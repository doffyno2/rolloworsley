# How to Lower Riding Training Costs

Riding is a great way to stay fit, enjoy the outdoors and even build a relationship with your horse, but it can be expensive. If you're looking for ways to cut back on riding training costs, there are a few simple strategies you can employ. 

## Establish a Budget 

The first step in reducing riding training costs is to establish a budget. This will help you figure out how much money you can realistically spend on training and make sure you don't overspend. Make sure to include all expenses, such as boarding fees, vet bills, and entry fees for competitions. Once you have a budget, you can start looking for ways to save money. 

## Shop Around 

When it comes to finding the best deal on riding training, it pays to shop around. Look for local riding schools and compare their fees and services. You may be able to find a school that offers lower fees or more specialized services. Also, consider taking lessons with an instructor who offers a lower hourly rate. This can be an especially good option for those on a tight budget. 

## Take Advantage of Discounts 

Many riding schools offer discounts for students who take regular lessons. If you take lessons regularly, make sure to ask about discounts. You may also be able to get a discount if you purchase a package of lessons. 

## Do It Yourself 

For some riders, taking lessons can be expensive. If you're looking for ways to keep costs down, consider doing some of the training yourself. You can find plenty of resources online and in books that can help you teach your horse basic commands and maneuvers. This can be a great way to save money while still ensuring that your horse is getting the training it needs. 

## Utilize Free Resources 

There are plenty of free resources available online to help you learn more about riding. Websites such as YouTube, Horse and Rider Magazine, and Equestrian Magazine offer valuable tips and advice. You can also find free online courses and tutorials to help you improve your riding skills. 

## Invest in Quality Gear 

Investing in quality riding gear can be a great way to save money in the long run. Good riding gear will last longer and help keep your horse safe and comfortable. Look for quality saddles, bridles, and other riding equipment that are designed to last. 

## Invest in Quality Care 

Taking care of your horse is essential to keeping riding costs down. Investing in regular visits from a vet, farrier, and other professionals can help keep your horse healthy and happy. This can help you avoid costly vet bills and other expenses down the line. 

## Get Involved 

Volunteering at local riding events and shows can be a great way to save money. Many shows offer free entry for volunteers, which can help you save money on entry fees. You may also be able to find volunteer positions at riding schools or stables, which can help you learn more about riding while also saving money.
