<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Marine boot camp is an intense and highly-regimented program that all Marines must go through in order to become enlisted members of the United States Marine Corps. It is a grueling experience that requires physical and mental strength, as well as a dedication to the Marine Corps values of honor, courage, and commitment. Throughout the program, Marines are assessed and evaluated on their skills, knowledge and abilities. Those who perform exceptionally well in the program may be rewarded with a promotion, allowing them to move up the ranks faster and have greater responsibilities in the Corps.</p>
