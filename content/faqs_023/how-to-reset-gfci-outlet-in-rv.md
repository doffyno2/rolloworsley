<p>If you own an RV, you know that it can be a costly endeavor to maintain and repair. One of the most common problems RV owners face is resetting a GFCI outlet. A GFCI, or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter, is a safety device designed to prevent electrical shocks and fires. If your GFCI outlet trips, you'll need to reset it before you can use your RV again. Fortunately, the process of resetting a GFCI outlet in an RV is relatively simple and can be done with a few basic tools.</p>

<h2>Tools You'll Need to Reset a GFCI Outlet in an RV</h2>

<p>To reset a GFCI outlet, you'll need only a few basic tools. A flat-head screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers, and a non-contact voltage tester are all you'll need. Make sure you have all the necessary tools before you begin the reset process.</p>

<h2>How to Reset a GFCI Outlet in an RV</h2>

<p>To reset a GFCI outlet in an RV, start by turning off the power to the outlet. You can do this by either unplugging the RV from the electrical source or by flipping the main breaker switch in the RV. Once the power is off, locate the GFCI outlet. Most GFCI outlets are located near sinks, showers, or other moisture-prone areas.</p>

<p>Once you've located the GFCI outlet, use a flat-head screwdriver to loosen the screws on the outlet. Carefully remove the outlet cover and locate the two reset buttons on the face of the outlet. Push the reset buttons in with a pair of needle-nose pliers. The reset buttons should stay in when you release the pressure. If they pop back out, the outlet has not been reset correctly. If this happens, repeat the process.</p>

<p>Once the reset buttons have been pushed in, test the GFCI outlet with a non-contact voltage tester. Place the tester near the outlet and make sure the light on the tester does not come on. If the light does come on, the outlet has not been reset correctly and you'll need to repeat the process.</p>

<p>Once the outlet has been tested and the light does not come on, replace the outlet cover. Make sure the screws are tightened securely before turning the power back on. Once the power is restored, the GFCI outlet should be reset and ready for use.</p>
