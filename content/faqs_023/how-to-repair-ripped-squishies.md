<p>If you have a ripped squishy, don't panic â€“ there are ways to repair it! Squishies are a popular toy among kids and adults alike, and they can easily become damaged or torn. Fortunately, there are a few simple tricks that you can use to repair your squishy and make it look as good as new.</p>

<h2>Materials Needed to Repair Ripped Squishies</h2>

<p>Before you start repairing your damaged squishy, you will need a few supplies. You will need a pair of scissors, some glue, a needle and thread, and a patch of fabric that matches the color of your squishy. If you don't have any fabric, you can also use a piece of felt or another soft material.</p>

<h2>Steps to Repair Ripped Squishies</h2>

<p>Once you have all the necessary supplies, you can begin repairing your squishy. Here are the steps to follow:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Cut the Torn Area</h3>

<p>First, use a pair of scissors to cut away any excess fabric that is sticking out from the tear. Make sure to cut away enough fabric so that you have a smooth surface to work with.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Glue the Torn Area</h3>

<p>Once you have cut away the excess fabric, use a strong glue to stick the edges of the tear together. Make sure to hold the fabric in place until the glue has dried completely.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Patch the Torn Area</h3>

<p>Once the glue has dried, you can use a piece of fabric to patch the tear. Cut a piece of fabric that is slightly larger than the tear and glue it to the squishy. Make sure to hold the fabric in place until the glue has dried completely.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Sew the Patch</h3>

<p>Once the patch is secure, use a needle and thread to sew the edges of the patch together. This will help ensure that the patch doesn't come off in the future.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Enjoy Your Squishy!</h3>

<p>Now that your squishy is repaired, you can enjoy it once again! Make sure to keep it away from any sharp objects or surfaces that could cause it to tear again.</p>
