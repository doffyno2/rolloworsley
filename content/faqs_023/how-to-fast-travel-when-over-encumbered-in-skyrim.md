<p>Skyrim is an open-world action role-playing game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks. It is the fifth main installment in The Elder Scrolls series, following The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The game is set in the province of Skyrim, a rugged and mountainous region of Tamriel, the continent on which the game is set. One of the most important aspects of the game is the ability to fast travel, which allows the player to quickly move from one location to another. However, this can be difficult if the player is carrying too much weight, as they will become over encumbered and unable to fast travel.</p>

<h2>What is Over Encumbrance in Skyrim?</h2>

<p>Over encumbrance in Skyrim occurs when a character is carrying too much weight. The total weight carried by a character is determined by the items they are carrying, as well as any armor and weapons they have equipped. If a character is carrying too much weight, they will become over encumbered and unable to move, making it impossible for them to fast travel. As a result, it is important to manage the weight of items that the player is carrying in order to avoid becoming over encumbered.</p>

<h2>How to Avoid Being Over Encumbered in Skyrim</h2>

<p>The best way to avoid becoming over encumbered in Skyrim is to manage the weight of items that the player is carrying. This can be done by limiting the number of items that are being carried. It is also important to equip armor and weapons that are light in weight and have a low encumbrance rating. Additionally, it is a good idea to keep some extra weight-reducing items on hand, such as potions of lightening, which can be used to temporarily reduce a character’s encumbrance.</p>

<h2>How to Fast Travel When Over Encumbered in Skyrim</h2>

One way is to use a horse, as horses can carry a large amount of weight without becoming over encumbered. Another way is to use a carriage, which can be found in cities.

Once the character is no longer over encumbered, they will be able to fast travel.</p>

<h2>Other Ways to Reduce Encumbrance in Skyrim</h2>
