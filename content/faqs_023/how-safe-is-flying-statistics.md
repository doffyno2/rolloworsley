<p>It is understandable if people feel anxious when it comes to travelling by air, especially when the media is full of stories of accidents and incidents involving aircraft. The truth is, flying is actually one of the safest forms of transport in the world and there are plenty of statistics and facts to back it up. In this article, we will take a look at the safety of flying, the statistics and facts which will hopefully ease your mind.</p>

<h2>What Are The Statistics?</h2>

<p>When it comes to the safety of flying, the statistics are overwhelmingly in favour of air travel. In fact, according to the National Safety Council, in the US the risk of dying in a plane crash is about 1 in 11 million. The risk of dying in a car crash is around 1 in 5,000. This means that you have a much higher chance of dying in a car than a plane.</p>

<p>In addition, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that the global air transport industry achieved an all-time safety record in 2019, with the number of fatal accidents falling to its lowest level since the 1940s. Furthermore, the global fatal accident rate for 2019 was 0.07 per million flights, the lowest ever recorded.</p>

<h2>What Are The Safety Measures?</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons why flying is so safe is due to the stringent safety measures that are taken by airlines and aviation authorities. All aircraft must be subjected to regular maintenance checks and safety inspections which must be passed before the aircraft can be certified to fly. Furthermore, all pilots are rigorously trained and must pass regular medical checks.</p>

<p>In addition, the latest technology is used to ensure the safety of passengers and crew. For example, aircraft are now fitted with a range of sophisticated sensors, computers and other systems which can detect any potential issues and alert the crew to take action. The cockpit is also fitted with an emergency oxygen supply, a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit.</p>

<h2>What Other Factors Contribute To The Safety Of Flying?</h2>

<p>In addition to the safety measures taken by airlines and aviation authorities, there are also several other factors which contribute to the safety of flying. For example, the flight route is carefully planned to avoid hazardous weather conditions and turbulence. Furthermore, aircraft are equipped with the latest navigation and communication systems to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Air traffic controllers also play an important role in the safety of flying. They use sophisticated radar systems to monitor the position of all aircraft in the airspace and to ensure that they are following the correct flight paths. They also keep an eye out for any potential issues which can be quickly addressed.</p>

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of Flying?</h2>

<p>Aside from the obvious safety benefits of flying, there are also a number of other benefits which make it an attractive option for travellers. For example, flying is much faster than other forms of transport and can help to reduce journey times significantly. Furthermore, air travel is often more comfortable than other forms of transport, with plenty of legroom and other amenities such as entertainment systems.</p>

<p>Finally, flying is also much more reliable than other forms of transport, with airlines offering a variety of services to ensure that your journey is as pleasant and stress-free as possible. This includes punctuality, baggage assistance and customer service.</p>
