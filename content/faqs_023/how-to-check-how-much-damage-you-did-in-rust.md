<p>Rust is an open-world survival game where players must scavenge for resources, build bases, and survive against other players, monsters, and the environment. It is a game of resource management and strategy, where players must balance the need for resources with the danger of being killed or lost in the wilderness. Rust is a game of risk and reward, and players must weigh the risks of entering dangerous areas against the rewards of obtaining better loot, crafting better weapons, and surviving longer. However, it can be difficult to gauge exactly how much damage you’ve done, and it’s important to check your progress. Here are some tips on how to check how much damage you did in Rust.</p>

<h2>Check Your Character Stats</h2>

<p>The first way to check how much damage you did in Rust is to check your character stats. Your character stats tell you how much damage you’ve done in game. To view your character stats, press the ‘C’ key while in-game. A window will open up with a list of your stats. Look for the ‘Damage Done’ stat, which will tell you how much damage you’ve done in total. It’s important to note that this is only damage done to animals, players, or structures and does not include damage done to yourself or teammates.</p>

<h2>Check Your Kill Log</h2>

<p>Another way to check how much damage you’ve done in Rust is to check your kill log. The kill log is a list of all the players, animals, and structures you’ve killed in-game. To view your kill log, press the ‘K’ key while in-game. The kill log will tell you how much damage you’ve done to each entity you’ve killed. It’s important to note that the kill log only shows damage done to players, animals, and structures and does not include damage done to yourself or teammates.</p>

<h2>Check Your Weapon Stats</h2>

<p>The final way to check how much damage you’ve done in Rust is to check your weapon stats. Your weapon stats tell you how much damage you’ve done with each weapon you’ve used in-game. To view your weapon stats, press the ‘W’ key while in-game. A window will open up with a list of your weapons and the damage you’ve done with each one. It’s important to note that this is only damage done to animals, players, or structures and does not include damage done to yourself or teammates.</p>
