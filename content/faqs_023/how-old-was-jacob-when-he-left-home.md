<p>Jacob is one of the most important figures in the Bible, and his life story is full of drama and intrigue. In this article, we'll explore the question of how old Jacob was when he left his home and set out on his journey of faith. We'll look at the Biblical account of Jacob's life, as well as other sources of information, to get a better understanding of when he left home and why.</p>

<h2>The Biblical Account of Jacob</h2>

<p>The Bible tells us that Jacob was the son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the grandson of Abraham and Sarah. Jacob's mother was barren until she received a divine blessing and gave birth to Jacob and his twin brother Esau. Jacob was a cunning and resourceful young man, and he used his skills to gain an advantage over his brother. Esau wanted to sell his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of lentil stew, and Jacob also tricked his father Isaac into giving him the blessing that was meant for Esau. This deception led to Esau's hatred of Jacob, and it was this resentment that eventually drove Jacob away from home.</p>

<h2>Jacob's Age When He Left Home</h2>

<p>The Bible does not give a precise age for Jacob when he left home, but it does tell us that he was a young man. According to Genesis 28:9, Jacob was about to turn 22 years old when he set out on his journey. This is significant because it is the age at which a young man would be expected to leave home and begin his own life. The Bible also tells us that Jacob had been living with his parents for 14 years before he left home, so he would have been around 36 when he departed.</p>

<h2>Why Did Jacob Leave Home?</h2>

<p>The Bible tells us that Jacob left home because of a conflict with his brother Esau. Esau had been sickened by Jacob's deception and was determined to get revenge. When Isaac gave Jacob the blessing that was meant for Esau, Esau became so angry that he threatened to kill Jacob. Fearing for his life, Jacob fled his home and went to live with his uncle Laban, who lived far away.</p>

<h2>Jacob's Journey of Faith</h2>

<p>Jacob's journey away from home was more than just a physical one - it was also a spiritual journey. As he traveled, Jacob encountered God in powerful ways, and through this experience he gained a better understanding of his faith and his purpose in life. Jacob's journey of faith culminated in a powerful dream in which God spoke to him and promised to be with him wherever he went. Through this experience, Jacob was able to find inner peace and strength, and he was able to use it to build a new life for himself.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Jacob was about 22 years old when he left his home in search of a better life. He was driven away by his brother Esau's hatred, but he soon found God and was able to use his faith to build a new life for himself.
