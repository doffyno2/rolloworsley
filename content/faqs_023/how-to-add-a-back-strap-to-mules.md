<p>Mules are an incredibly fashionable and comfortable style of shoe, but they can often be a bit tricky to style. Adding a back strap to your mules is a great way to add a bit of extra flair to your look. This article will provide you with a comprehensive guide on how to add a back strap to your mules in a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>

<p>Before you get started, you'll need to make sure that you have the necessary tools and materials. In order to add a back strap to your mules, you'll need to have a leather strap, a leather punch, a hammer, a pair of scissors, and a needle and thread.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Measure the Strap</h2>

<p>The first step in adding a back strap to your mules is to measure the strap. You'll want to make sure that the strap is long enough to fit around your foot and that it's not too tight. To do this, measure the circumference of the top of your foot and then subtract 1.5 inches. This will give you the length of the strap that you'll need.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Cut the Strap</h2>

<p>Once you have the length of the strap that you need, use a pair of scissors to cut it to size. Make sure that the ends of the strap are even and that there are no loose threads.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Punch the Holes</h2>

<p>The next step is to punch holes in the strap. To do this, use a leather punch and a hammer to create two evenly-spaced holes in the strap. Make sure that the holes are big enough for the needle and thread to fit through.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Sew the Strap</h2>

<p>Once you have punched the holes in the strap, it's time to sew it onto the mules. To do this, take a needle and thread and begin to stitch the strap onto the mules. Start by threading the needle through one of the holes in the strap and then sewing it through the corresponding hole in the mules. Repeat this process until the entire strap has been attached.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Secure the Strap</h2>

<p>Once you have stitched the strap onto the mules, you'll need to secure it in place. To do this, tie a knot at the end of the thread and then cut off any excess thread. This will ensure that the strap stays securely attached to the mules.</p>
