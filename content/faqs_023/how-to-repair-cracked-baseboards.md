<p>Baseboards are often the finishing touch to any room, providing the perfect frame for a room. But over time, baseboards can crack and break, leaving a room looking unfinished. Fortunately, repairing a cracked baseboard is simpler than you might think, and with the right tools, you can have your baseboard looking like new in no time.</p>

<h2>What Causes Cracks in Baseboards?</h2>

<p>Cracks in baseboards are usually caused by expansion and contraction due to changes in temperature, humidity, or other environmental factors. These environmental changes can cause the wood to expand, resulting in cracks. In addition, baseboards can also suffer from water damage, which can cause them to warp and crack.</p>

<h2>How to Repair Cracked Baseboards</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a cracked baseboard is to assess the damage. If the crack is small, you can repair it with a wood filler. If the crack is larger, you may need to replace the entire baseboard. Once youâ€™ve determined the extent of the damage, you can start the repair process.</p>

<h3>Wood Filler</h3>

<p>If the crack is small, you can repair it with a wood filler. A wood filler is a substance that is used to fill in cracks and gaps in wood. It can be purchased at most hardware stores and comes in a variety of colors to match the color of your baseboard. To use the wood filler, simply fill the crack with the filler and allow it to dry. Once dry, sand the area to ensure a smooth finish.</p>

<h3>Replacing the Baseboard</h3>

<p>If the crack is large or the baseboard is warped or broken, you may need to replace the baseboard entirely. To do this, you will need to remove the old baseboard and install the new one. To remove the old baseboard, use a pry bar to gently pry it away from the wall. Be sure to wear protective gloves and goggles to protect yourself from any splinters or dust.</p>

<p>Once the old baseboard is removed, you can begin installing the new one. Measure the length of the space between the wall and the floor and cut the new baseboard to fit. Use a miter saw to cut the corners of the baseboard to ensure a snug fit. Secure the baseboard to the wall using nails or screws. Make sure the baseboard is level before securing it to the wall.</p>
