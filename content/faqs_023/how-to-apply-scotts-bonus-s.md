<h2>What is Scotts Bonus S?</h2>

Scotts Bonus S is a granular fertilizer that contains a unique combination of slow-release nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. This combination of nutrients provides lawns and gardens with a steady, consistent supply of essential nutrients to promote healthy growth. Scotts Bonus S also contains an extended-release formula that helps to ensure that plants get the nutrients they need over a longer period of time. The slow-release formula also helps to reduce the risk of nutrient runoff and leaching, which can damage the environment.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Applying Scotts Bonus S?</h2>

Applying Scotts Bonus S to your lawn and garden can provide a number of benefits. The slow-release formula helps to ensure that plants get the nutrients they need for healthy growth and development. The extended-release formula helps to reduce the risk of nutrient runoff and leaching, which can damage the environment. Additionally, Scotts Bonus S helps to reduce the need for frequent applications of fertilizer, which can save you time and money.

<h2>How to Apply Scotts Bonus S</h2>

Applying Scotts Bonus S is easy and only takes a few minutes. First, you should determine the size of your lawn or garden and calculate the amount of Scotts Bonus S that you need. You can find this information on the Scotts Bonus S product label. Next, spread the fertilizer evenly over the lawn or garden. Use a spreader to ensure that the application is even. Once the fertilizer is applied, lightly water the area to help the fertilizer soak into the soil.

If you are looking for more consistent results, you may want to consider applying Scotts Bonus S every few months.
