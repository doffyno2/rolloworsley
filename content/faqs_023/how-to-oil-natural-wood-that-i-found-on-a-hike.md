<p>If you’ve been out on a hike and come across a piece of natural wood, you might be wondering what to do with it. Oiling natural wood is a great way to preserve its beauty and ensure it will last for years to come. Oiling natural wood can be done in four simple steps, and all you need is a few basic supplies. Read on to learn more about the process.</p>

<h2>Gather Your Supplies</h2>

<p>First, you’ll need to gather the supplies you’ll need to oil the wood. You’ll need to get the following items:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A natural oil, such as linseed oil or tung oil</li>
    <li>A clean cloth</li>
    <li>A soft brush</li>
    <li>Protective gloves</li>
</ul>

<h2>Clean the Wood</h2>

<p>The next step is to clean the wood. Start by brushing off any dirt or debris from the surface of the wood with a soft brush. You can also use a vacuum cleaner if you have access to one. Then, use a damp cloth to wipe down the wood and remove any remaining dirt or debris. Once the wood is clean, let it dry completely.</p>

<h2>Apply the Oil</h2>

<p>Once the wood is completely dry, it’s time to apply the oil. Start by putting on a pair of protective gloves. Then, pour a small amount of oil onto a clean cloth. Gently rub the oil onto the wood in a circular motion, making sure to cover all areas. Let the oil sit on the wood for at least 15 minutes before wiping off any excess.</p>

<h2>Repeat the Process</h2>

<p>Once you’ve applied the oil and wiped off any excess, you’ll need to repeat the process. You’ll need to apply multiple coats of oil to the wood in order for it to be properly protected. Let each coat of oil dry completely before applying the next. You’ll know when the wood is sufficiently oiled when it has a nice, glossy finish.</p>
