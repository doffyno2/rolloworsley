<p>Mortar is a type of cement used in masonry construction that is used to bond together stones, bricks, and blocks. It is made of a combination of sand, water, and cement. Mortar can be used to cap a stone wall, providing the wall with a secure and attractive finish. Capping a stone wall with mortar is a relatively simple process, but it requires patience and attention to detail to ensure the mortar is applied correctly.</p>

<h2>Tools Needed</h2>

<p>Before beginning the process of capping a stone wall with mortar, several tools must be gathered:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Masonry trowel</li>
  <li>Bucket</li>
  <li>Mortar mix</li>
  <li>Rubber gloves</li>
  <li>A stiff brush</li>
  <li>Goggles</li>
  <li>Work gloves</li>
  <li>A small hammer</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing the Mortar</h2>

<p>The first step in the process of capping a stone wall with mortar is to prepare the mortar. A mortar mix should be purchased from a home improvement store or online. The mortar mix should be mixed with water and stirred until it is the consistency of thick, creamy peanut butter. Once the mortar is mixed, it should be placed in a bucket and set aside.</p>

<h2>Cleaning the Stone Wall</h2>

<p>The stone wall must be cleaned before the mortar can be applied. A stiff brush should be used to remove any dirt, debris, or loose mortar from the stones. The stones should then be rinsed with water to remove any remaining debris. Once the stones are clean, they should be allowed to dry completely before the mortar is applied.</p>

<h2>Applying the Mortar</h2>

<p>Once the stones are dry, the mortar can be applied. A masonry trowel should be used to spread a thin layer of mortar onto the stones. The mortar should be spread evenly and pressed firmly into the stones. The stones should be covered completely with the mortar. Once the mortar has been applied, it should be left to dry for at least 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Curing the Mortar</h2>

<p>Once the mortar has dried, it should be cured. This can be done by spraying the wall with a light mist of water and covering it with plastic sheeting for at least three days. This will help the mortar to cure properly and ensure a strong bond between the stones and mortar.</p>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>

<p>Once the mortar has been cured, any excess mortar should be removed from the stones and the wall should be inspected for any cracks or gaps. If any are found, they should be filled with additional mortar. Finally, the wall should be sealed with a masonry sealer to provide additional protection and an attractive finish.</p>
