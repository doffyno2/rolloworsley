<p>Plaster window sills are a common feature in older homes, but they can suffer from cracking, crumbling and other damage over time. Fortunately, repairing a plaster window sill is not too difficult, and with the right tools and materials, you can get your window sill back to its original condition. Read on to learn how to repair a plaster window sill.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Area</h2>

<p>The first step in repairing a plaster window sill is to prepare the area. You’ll need to remove any dust, dirt, and debris that has accumulated on the surface of the window sill. You can do this by using a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment, or by using a soft cloth and a mild detergent. Once the area is clean, you’ll need to inspect it for any cracks or other damage.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Make Repairs</h2>

<p>If the window sill has any cracks or other areas of damage, you’ll need to repair them before you can move on to the next step. To do this, you’ll need a few basic materials: a putty knife, a tube of plaster repair compound, a small container of water, and some damp cloths. Start by using the putty knife to scrape away any loose or crumbling plaster. Then, use the plaster repair compound to fill in any cracks or other areas of damage. To do this, simply apply the compound to the area with the putty knife, and then smooth it out with the damp cloth. Once the area is repaired, you’ll need to allow it to dry for at least 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Apply Primer</h2>

<p>Once the area is repaired and dry, you’ll need to apply a primer. This will help the paint adhere better to the window sill. You can purchase a primer specifically designed for use on plaster surfaces, or you can use a universal primer. Once you’ve applied the primer, you’ll need to allow it to dry for at least 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Paint the Window Sill</h2>

<p>Once the primer is dry, you can paint the window sill. You can use either a brush or a roller to apply the paint. If you’re using a brush, make sure to go in the same direction with each stroke, and use long, even strokes. Once you’ve applied the paint, you’ll need to allow it to dry for at least 24 hours before you can use the window sill again.</p>
