<p>If you own a refrigerator, you may have encountered the need to replace a refrigerator thermostat. This is an important component of your refrigerator, as it is responsible for regulating the temperature of the interior of the appliance. A faulty thermostat can cause the refrigerator to run too hot or too cold, or even shut down completely, leading to spoiled food and other costly repairs.</p>

<p>So, how much does it cost to replace a refrigerator thermostat? The answer depends on a few factors, including the make and model of the refrigerator, the type of refrigerator thermostat, and the cost of labor. In general, replacing a refrigerator thermostat can range from $75 to $350, with the average cost being around $200.</p>

<h2>Types of Refrigerator Thermostats</h2>

<p>There are two main types of refrigerator thermostats: mechanical and electronic. Mechanical thermostats are the most common, and are usually found in older models. They work by controlling the amount of refrigerant that is circulated through the coils, which in turn regulates the temperature of the refrigerator. These thermostats are relatively easy to replace, but can be more expensive to repair and replace.</p>

<p>Electronic thermostats are more sophisticated and are found in newer refrigerator models. They use computerized sensors to regulate the temperature of the refrigerator, and can be programmed to keep the temperature at a certain level. These thermostats are more expensive to replace, but are more reliable and efficient.</p>

<h2>Cost of Replacing a Refrigerator Thermostat</h2>

<p>The cost of replacing a refrigerator thermostat can vary depending on the make and model of the refrigerator, the type of thermostat, and the cost of labor. The cost of purchasing the thermostat itself can range from $20 to $250, depending on the make and model of the refrigerator. The cost of labor for installing the thermostat can range from $75 to $150, depending on the difficulty of the job and the technician's rates.</p>

<p>In addition to the cost of the thermostat and labor, there may also be additional costs for any additional parts needed, such as wiring or insulation. These costs can range from $25 to $100, depending on the type and quantity of parts needed. The total cost to replace a refrigerator thermostat can range from $75 to $350, with the average cost being around $200.</p>
