<p>If your Razor electric bike won't move, you're likely frustrated and ready to get it running again. Fortunately, there are a few things you can do to troubleshoot the issue and get your electric bike back on the road. Read on to learn more about how to investigate the problem, what to do if you find a possible cause, and how to get your electric bike back up and running.</p>

<h2>Inspect the Battery</h2>

<p>The first step when troubleshooting an electric bike that won't move is to check the battery. This is especially true if the bike was previously working and then suddenly stopped. Start by connecting the battery to the charger and see if it's charging. If not, you'll need to replace the battery. If it does charge, try turning on the bike. If it starts and then stops, the issue could be with the battery or the battery connection.</p>

<h2>Check the Electric Motors</h2>

<p>If the battery is working, the next step is to check the electric motor. This is because it's possible for the motor to malfunction and prevent the bike from running. Start by inspecting the motor for signs of damage or corrosion. If you find any damage or corrosion, it's likely that the motor needs to be replaced. If there's no visible damage or corrosion, use a multimeter to test the resistance of the motor.</p>

<h2>Inspect the Throttle and Pedals</h2>

<p>Another common cause of an electric bike that won't move is a faulty throttle or pedals. If the throttle isn't working properly, it won't be able to send the proper signals to the motor. Similarly, if the pedals aren't working properly, they won't be able to send the right signals to the motor. To test the throttle and pedals, connect them to a multimeter and test the resistance.</p>

<h2>Check the Wiring</h2>

<p>If you don't find any issues with the battery, motor, throttle, or pedals, it's time to check the wiring. If there are any loose or damaged wires, it can prevent the electric bike from running properly. To inspect the wiring, open up the control panel and inspect each of the wires. Look for any signs of damage, corrosion, or loose connections. If you find any damaged or corroded wires, it's best to replace them.</p>

<h2>Replace the Controller</h2>

<p>If you find no issues with the battery, motor, throttle, pedals, or wiring, it's likely that the controller is the problem. The controller is responsible for sending the right signals to the motor, so if it's not working properly, the bike won't move. To test the controller, connect it to a multimeter and check the resistance. If it's not within the proper range, you'll need to replace the controller.</p>
