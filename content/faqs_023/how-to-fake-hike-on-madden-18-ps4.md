Playing Madden 18 on the Playstation 4 (PS4) console can be a great way to pass the time, practice your skills, and improve your game. The game allows you to create a team of players and compete against other human or computer-controlled teams. One of the most popular strategies employed in the game is the fake hike, which involves changing the ball carrier's direction at the last second to throw off the other team's defensive line. This can be done by using a few simple techniques.

<h2>How to Fake Hike on Madden 18 PS4</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Get Set Up</h3>

The fake hike is best used when the defensive line is spread out and is not in close proximity to the ball carrier. To ensure that the defense is spread out and not in close proximity to the ball carrier, it is best to line up the ball carrier in the shotgun formation. The shotgun formation will give the ball carrier more time to fake the hike and make the defense think he is going in a different direction.

<h3>Step 2: Make Your Move</h3>

Once the ball carrier is lined up in the shotgun formation, he will need to make sure he is ready to make his move. To do this, the ball carrier can take a few steps back and to the side of the line of scrimmage. This will give him an extra few yards of space to fake the hike and create confusion for the defense.

<h3>Step 3: Execute the Fake Hike</h3>

Once the ball carrier is in position, he will need to execute the fake hike. To do this, he will need to make a quick, sharp movement toward the sideline. This will cause the defense to think he is going to run outside. At the same time, he will need to quickly pivot and run back toward the middle of the field. This will cause the defense to pause for a moment, giving the ball carrier an opportunity to gain some extra yardage. 

<h3>Step 4: Follow Through</h3>

Once the ball carrier has successfully executed the fake hike, it is important that he follows through on the play. This means that he will need to keep his eyes up and look for open receivers or running lanes. If there is an open receiver, he will need to make a quick pass to gain extra yardage. If there is an open running lane, he will need to take it to gain extra yardage.
