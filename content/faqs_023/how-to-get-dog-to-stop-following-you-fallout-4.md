<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Fallout 4 is an open world action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks, released worldwide in November 2015. In the game, players take control of a character called the "Sole Survivor" and explore the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the Commonwealth. One of the most common challenges players face in Fallout 4 is keeping their dog companions from following them everywhere. In this article, we will discuss how to stop your dog from following you in Fallout 4 and provide some tips to help you keep your dog from getting in the way.</p>

<h2>Why Dogs Follow in Fallout 4</h2>
<p>In Fallout 4, dogs are loyal companions that can follow the player around and help out in combat. The game allows players to build relationships with their canine companions, which can help them become better fighters and more efficient scavengers. However, it can be annoying when your dog follows you everywhere and gets in the way. Fortunately, there are several ways to prevent this from happening.</p>

<h2>How to Stop Your Dog from Following You in Fallout 4</h2>
<p>The first way to stop your dog from following you in Fallout 4 is to use the “Wait” command. When the player issues this command, the dog will stay in one spot and will not follow the player. This is a good option if you need to leave the dog behind while you explore an area, but don’t want it to wander off. The “Wait” command can be issued by pressing the triangle button on the PlayStation 4 controller, or the Y button on the Xbox One controller.</p>

<p>Another way to stop your dog from following you in Fallout 4 is to use the “Send Away” command. This command will tell the dog to go back to its home and will prevent it from following the player. This is a good option if you need the dog to stay in a certain area or if you want to go somewhere without it. The “Send Away” command can be issued by pressing the square button on the PlayStation 4 controller, or the X button on the Xbox One controller.</p>

<p>Finally, you can also stop your dog from following you in Fallout 4 by equipping it with a Dog Collar. This item can be crafted at a Chemistry Station and will prevent your dog from following you when it is equipped. This is a good option if you want to keep your dog from getting in the way or if you need it to stay in one spot for a long period of time. The Dog Collar can be equipped by pressing the select button on the PlayStation 4 controller, or the back button on the Xbox One controller.</p>

<h2>Tips for Keeping Your Dog from Getting in the Way</h2>
<p>In addition to the methods mentioned above, there are also a few tips for keeping your dog from getting in the way. The first tip is to make sure that you keep your dog’s needs in mind when exploring a new area. If you know that your dog won’t be able to make it through a certain area, then it’s best to leave it behind. It’s also important to keep an eye on your dog and make sure it doesn’t wander off or get into any trouble.</p>

<p>Another tip is to make sure that you give your dog plenty of love and attention. Dogs are social creatures, and they need affection and companionship just like humans do. If you take the time to give your dog love and attention on a regular basis, then it will be less likely to follow you everywhere and get in the way.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s important to make sure that you feed your dog a healthy diet. Dogs require a balanced diet of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats in order to stay healthy. By feeding your dog a healthy diet, you can ensure that it has the energy it needs to stay active and follow you without getting in the way.</p>
