<p>Dry erase boards are a popular choice for classrooms, offices, and homes. They are convenient, easy to use, and easy to maintain. However, dry erase boards are not indestructible and can get scratched over time. Scratches can lead to decreased performance and a less impressive look. Fortunately, it is possible to repair scratches on dry erase boards with a few simple steps.</p>

<h2>What Causes Scratches on Dry Erase Boards?</h2>

<p>Scratches on dry erase boards can be caused by several factors. In classrooms and offices, scratches are often caused by erasers, markers, or abrasive cleaning materials. In homes, scratches may be caused by pets, furniture, or anything else that comes into contact with the board. Scratches can also be caused by improper installation.</p>

<h2>How to Repair Scratches on Dry Erase Boards</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Clean the Board</h3>

<p>The first step in repairing scratches on dry erase boards is to clean the board. Use a dry erase board cleaner and a soft cloth to remove any dirt, dust, and debris from the board. Be sure to clean both sides of the board thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Identify the Scratches</h3>
