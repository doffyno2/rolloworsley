<p>If you're an avid cyclist, you know how important it is to have the right size crank on your bike. A crank that is too long or too short can affect your performance and even cause injury. So, it's important to make sure that you measure correctly and get the right size. Here's what you need to know about how to measure bicycle crank length.</p>

<h2>What is Bicycle Crank Length?</h2>

Generally, the longer the crank arm, the easier it is to pedal, but it also increases your risk of overstraining your knees.</p>

<h2>Why Measure Crank Length?</h2>

Too long a crank arm can make pedaling easier, but it also increases the risk of over-straining your knees and lower back. So, it's important to measure your crank arm to ensure that it is the right size for your bike and the type of riding you do.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turn your bike upside down and position it on a flat, level surface.</li>
  <li>Measure the distance between the center of the crank arm and the center of the bottom bracket.</li>
