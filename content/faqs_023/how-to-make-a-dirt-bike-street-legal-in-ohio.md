<p>Ohio is a great place for dirt biking. However, if you want to take your bike out on the open road, you'll need to make sure it is street legal. The process of making a dirt bike street legal in Ohio is relatively straightforward, but there are a few steps that must be taken in order to comply with state regulations. This article will provide an overview of the process and explain what you need to do in order to make your dirt bike street legal in Ohio.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Get a Title and Registration</h2>

<p>The first step in making your dirt bike street legal in Ohio is to obtain a title and registration. This can be done through the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV). You will need to fill out an application, which can be obtained from the BMV website or in person at any BMV office. You will also need to provide proof of ownership, such as a bill of sale or a certificate of origin. Once the application is approved, you will be issued a title and registration.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Get a Motorcycle Safety Inspection</h2>

<p>The next step is to get a motorcycle safety inspection. This is done at an authorized inspection station, which can be found at most motorcycle dealership locations. During the inspection, a certified inspector will check to make sure that all of the components of your dirt bike comply with Ohio's safety regulations. This includes checking for proper lighting, brakes, tires, and more. Once the inspection is complete, the inspector will provide you with a certificate of inspection, which is required for the registration process.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Install Street-Legal Equipment</h2>

<p>In order to make your dirt bike street legal in Ohio, you will need to install certain equipment. This includes items such as a horn, mirrors, and turn signals. You will also need to install a U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) approved tire, which must have a tread pattern that is designed for street use. Additionally, you will need to install a rear license plate holder, which must be securely mounted to the bike.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Obtain Insurance</h2>

<p>Once your dirt bike is equipped with street-legal equipment, you will need to obtain insurance. In Ohio, all motorcycles must be covered by liability insurance in order to be registered. You will need to provide proof of insurance to the BMV when you complete the registration process. It is important to note that you will not be able to drive your bike on public roads without insurance.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Register Your Dirt Bike</h2>

<p>Once you have obtained a title and registration, completed a safety inspection, and obtained insurance, you will be ready to register your dirt bike. You can do this online or in person at the BMV. You will need to provide the necessary paperwork, including the certificate of inspection and proof of insurance. Once your application is approved, you will be issued a registration card and your dirt bike will be officially street legal in Ohio.</p>
