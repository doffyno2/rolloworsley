<p>Homemade dog treats are a great way to show your pup some extra love. Not only can you control the ingredients, but you can also customize the treats to suit your pup’s needs. However, if you’re not careful, your homemade dog treats could become moldy, making them unsafe for your pup to eat. Here’s how to keep your homemade dog treats fresh and mold-free.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Recipe</h2>

<p>The first step in keeping your homemade dog treats from molding is to choose the right recipe. Many recipes, especially those with a lot of wet ingredients, will become moldy faster than recipes with drier ingredients. Look for recipes that contain only a few wet ingredients, such as peanut butter, pumpkin puree, applesauce or eggs. You should also avoid recipes that contain cheese, as this is prone to molding quickly. If you’re not sure which recipes are best for keeping your homemade dog treats fresh, ask your vet for advice.</p>

<h2>Store the Treats Properly</h2>

<p>The next step in keeping your homemade dog treats from molding is to store them properly. If you store them in an airtight container, like a glass jar, they should last for several weeks. If you’re using a plastic container, make sure it is food-grade and that it is sealed properly. It’s also important to keep the treats away from direct sunlight and to avoid storing them in damp locations, such as a humid basement or garage.</p>

<h2>Make the Treats in Small Batches</h2>

<p>If you’re making large batches of homemade dog treats, you may be tempted to store them in the refrigerator or freezer. However, this isn’t always a good idea. Refrigerating or freezing the treats can cause them to become soggy, and this can make them more likely to become moldy. If you’re making large batches of treats, it’s best to make them in smaller batches and store the extras in the freezer. This will help keep them fresh for longer.</p>

<h2>Use Preservatives</h2>

<p>If you’re making dog treats with wet ingredients, such as eggs, applesauce or peanut butter, it’s a good idea to add a preservative. Natural preservatives, such as apple cider vinegar, can help keep the treats fresh for up to a month. You can also use commercial preservatives, such as citric acid or sodium benzoate, but make sure to follow the directions on the package. Too much preservative can be dangerous for your pup.</p>

<h2>Bake the Treats Thoroughly</h2>

<p>When baking homemade dog treats, it’s important to make sure they’re cooked thoroughly. If the treats aren’t baked long enough, they won’t be completely dry, and this can make them more prone to molding. Make sure to follow the instructions on the recipe and to check the treats with a toothpick or thermometer to make sure they’re done. This will help keep them from becoming moldy.</p>
