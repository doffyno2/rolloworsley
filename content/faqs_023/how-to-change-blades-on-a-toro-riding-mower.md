<p>Maintaining a Toro riding mower is an important part of keeping your lawn looking its best. One of the most important parts of the maintenance process is changing the blades on your mower. Not only will this help your mower run more efficiently, but it will also help you to keep your lawn looking healthy and beautiful. In this article, we will explain how to change the blades on a Toro riding mower.</p>

<h2>Gather the Necessary Tools and Parts</h2>

<p>Before you begin, it is important to make sure that you have all the necessary tools and parts on hand. You will need a new set of blades, a socket wrench, and a pair of work gloves. Make sure that the blades you purchase are the correct size for your mower. You can check the size on the manufacturer’s website or in the owner’s manual.</p>

<h2>Remove the Old Blades</h2>

<p>Once you have the new blades, you can begin the process of changing them. Start by removing the old blades from the mower. First, turn off the mower and wait for it to come to a complete stop. Then, use the socket wrench to remove the bolts that hold the old blades in place. Once they are removed, you can carefully lift the old blades off the mower.</p>

<h2>Install the New Blades</h2>

<p>Now it is time to install the new blades. Take the new blades and place them onto the mower, making sure that they are the right way round. Once they are in place, use the socket wrench to carefully tighten the bolts that hold the blades in place. Make sure that they are securely tightened, as this will help to ensure that the blades remain in place while you are mowing.</p>

<h2>Test the Blades</h2>

<p>Once you have finished installing the new blades, it is important to test them to make sure that they are working properly. Start by turning on the mower and listening for any odd noises that could indicate a problem. Then, take the mower for a test drive and make sure that it is running smoothly and that the blades are cutting grass properly.</p>
