<p>Hydro Flasks are a popular type of vacuum insulated water bottle that are designed to keep drinks cold for up to 24 hours and hot for up to 12 hours. They are made from high-grade stainless steel and are extremely durable, but they can still be damaged. One of the most common types of damage is a dent, which can be caused by dropping or banging the bottle on something. Fortunately, there are a few simple steps that can be taken to fix a dented Hydro Flask.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Gather the Supplies</h2>

<p>The first step in fixing a dented Hydro Flask is to gather the necessary supplies. You will need a heat gun, a rubber mallet, a rubber pad, and a plastic spoon. The heat gun will be used to heat up the metal and make it easier to reshape. The rubber mallet and pad will be used to gently tap the dent out. The plastic spoon should be placed inside the bottle to prevent the heat from damaging the inside of the flask.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Heat the Metal</h2>

<p>Once you have gathered the necessary supplies, you can begin to heat the metal. Start by setting the heat gun to the lowest setting and placing it about two inches from the dented area. Move the gun in a circular motion, slowly increasing the heat as you go. After a few minutes, the metal should be warm enough for you to continue.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Tap the Dent Out</h2>

<p>Once the metal is warm, you can begin to tap the dent out. Place the rubber pad on the bottom of the flask and the rubber mallet on top. Gently tap the dent with the mallet until it has been flattened out. Make sure to move the pad and mallet around the flask to ensure that it is evenly flattened.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Check for Air Leaks</h2>

<p>Once the dent has been removed, you should check the flask for any air leaks. Place your ear up against the flask and listen for any escaping air. If you hear any escaping air, there may be a crack or hole in the flask. If this is the case, you will need to purchase a new flask.</p>
