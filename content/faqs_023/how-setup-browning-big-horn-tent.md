<li>Tent poles</li>
<li>Tent fly</li>

<h2>Step By Step Instructions For Setting Up The Browning Big Horn Tent</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Choose Your Campsite</h3>

The first step in setting up your Browning Big Horn Tent is choosing the right campsite. Look for a flat, open area that is free of rocks, sticks, and other debris. Make sure the area has good drainage and is not too close to water sources. If you need to, use a shovel to remove any rocks or other debris that may be in the way.

<h3>Step 2: Lay Out The Ground Cloth</h3>

Once you’ve chosen your campsite, the next step is to lay out the ground cloth. This will provide an extra layer of protection against water and other elements. Make sure the ground cloth is large enough to cover the entire tent.

<h3>Step 3: Assemble The Tent Poles</h3>

The next step is to assemble the tent poles. Take the tent poles and fit them together according to the instructions. Make sure the poles are securely connected and that there are no gaps between the pieces.

<h3>Step 4: Place The Tent Poles In The Tent’s Grommets</h3>

Once the tent poles are assembled, the next step is to place them in the tent’s grommets. The grommets are the small holes at the corners of the tent. Make sure the poles are securely in place and that the poles are evenly distributed.

<h3>Step 5: Secure The Tent Poles With Stakes</h3>

Once the tent poles are in place, the next step is to secure them with stakes. Use a hammer or mallet to drive the stakes into the ground. Make sure the stakes are firmly in place and that the tent poles are securely attached.

<h3>Step 6: Attach The Tent Fly</h3>

Once the tent poles are secured, the next step is to attach the tent fly. This is the canvas material that goes over the outside of the tent. Make sure the tent fly is securely attached and that all the seams are sealed.

<h3>Step 7: Enjoy Your Camping Adventure</h3>

Now that your Browning Big Horn Tent is set up, you’re ready to enjoy your camping adventure. Make sure to follow all safety guidelines and to check the weather regularly. Have fun and enjoy your camping adventure!
