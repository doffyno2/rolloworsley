<h2>What are Elbow to Knee Crunches?</h2>

<p>Elbow to knee crunches are a type of core exercise that focuses on the abdominal muscles. The basic movement involves bringing one elbow to the opposite knee, while keeping your back flat on the ground. This movement is repeated with the other elbow and knee, in a criss-cross pattern. This exercise is great for strengthening the core and developing balance. It can also be done with added variations for a tougher workout.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Elbow to Knee Crunches</h2>

<p>Before starting elbow to knee crunches, it’s important to prepare your body for the exercise. Start by warming up with a few minutes of light cardio, such as jogging or walking.

This will help you get the most out of your workout, and help prevent injury.</p>

<h2>How to Do Elbow to Knee Crunches?</h2>

<p>Once you’ve warmed up and stretched, it’s time to do the exercise. Start by lying on your back on the floor, with your legs bent and feet flat on the ground. Place your hands behind your head, with your elbows out to the sides. This is your starting position.</p>

<p>From here, engage your core muscles and lift your shoulders off the floor. At the same time, bring your left elbow towards your right knee, and then alternate to the other side.
