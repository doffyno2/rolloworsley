<h2>Tools Needed to Repair Screw Holes in Fiberglass Shower</h2>

<h3>Step 3: Apply the Fiberglass Patching Compound</h3>

<h3>Step 5: Apply the Sealant</h3>

<p>Once the area is sanded, apply a sealant to the area to help protect it from water damage. Make sure to apply a generous amount of sealant to all sides of the patch. This will help ensure that the patch is properly sealed and will last for years to come.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Replace the Screws</h3>

<p>Once the area is sealed, use a screwdriver to replace the screws that were removed in the first step. Make sure that the screws are tightened securely to ensure that the patch doesn’t come off.</p>
