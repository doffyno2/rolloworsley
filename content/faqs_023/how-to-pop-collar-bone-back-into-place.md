<p>At some point in your life, you may experience a dislocated collar bone, which can be extremely painful and uncomfortable. It can happen due to a sudden impact or an accident. Fortunately, although it may be difficult, it is possible to pop your collar bone back into place without the help of a doctor or a physical therapist. This article will show you how to do it safely. </p>

<h2>What is a Dislocated Collar Bone?</h2>

<p>A dislocated collar bone, or clavicle, is a common injury in which the bone is displaced from its normal position.

A dislocated collar bone can cause intense pain and swelling, and can limit your ability to move your shoulder.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Intense pain in the shoulder or collar bone area</li>
