<h2>How to Climb Cage in WWE 2K19</h2>

Climbing the cage in WWE 2K19 is a fairly simple process, but it requires a bit of practice to master. Here are the steps you should follow:

<h3>Step 1: Approach the Cage</h3>

The first step is to approach the cage and stand close to it. You should make sure that you are standing close enough that you can reach out and touch the walls of the cage. 

<h3>Step 2: Jump onto the Cage</h3>

Once you are close enough to the cage, you should jump onto it. You can do this by pressing the jump button (X on PS4, A on Xbox). You should make sure that you are jumping high enough that you can grab onto the walls of the cage. 

<h3>Step 3: Climb the Cage</h3>

Once you have grabbed onto the walls of the cage, you should begin to climb. To do this, you should press the grab button (Square on PS4, X on Xbox) and then use the left analog stick to climb up the cage. You can also use the up arrow button (D-pad up on both systems) to help you climb. 

<h3>Step 4: Jump off the Cage</h3>

Once you have climbed to the top of the cage, you should jump off onto your opponent. This can be done by pressing the jump button (X on PS4, A on Xbox) while you are at the top of the cage.
