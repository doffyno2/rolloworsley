<p>At some point, many homeowners find themselves in need of a riding lawn mower. For those with larger yards, a riding mower can be a great time-saver, and Troy-Bilt offers a variety of models to suit most needs and budgets. One of the most common complaints about Troy-Bilt riding mowers is that the shifter is too short for drivers with longer legs. Fortunately, this is a relatively simple problem to fix. Below, we'll discuss the steps for extending the shifter on a Troy-Bilt riding mower.</p>

<h2>Tools and Supplies Needed</h2>

<p>To extend the shifter on a Troy-Bilt riding mower, you'll need the following tools and supplies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phillips head screwdriver</li>
  <li>Adjustable wrench</li>
  <li>Replacement shifter extension</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Remove the Old Shifter</h2>

<p>The first step is to remove the old shifter from the mower. To do this, you'll need to locate the shifter cable, which is usually located on the left side of the mower. Once you've located the cable, use a Phillips head screwdriver to loosen the two screws that hold the shifter in place. Once the screws are loosened, you should be able to pull the shifter off the mower.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Install the New Shifter</h2>

<p>Once the old shifter is removed, you can begin to install the new shifter extension. The shifter extension should come with mounting hardware, so you'll need to use an adjustable wrench to secure the extension to the mower. Once the extension is in place, you can reattach the shifter cable to the shifter. Make sure to tighten the screws securely.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Test the New Shifter</h2>

<p>Once the new shifter is installed, you'll need to test it to make sure it works properly. To do this, start the mower and put it into gear. If the shifter is working correctly, you should be able to easily shift from forward to reverse and back again. If you encounter any resistance or difficulty shifting, you may need to make further adjustments.</p>
