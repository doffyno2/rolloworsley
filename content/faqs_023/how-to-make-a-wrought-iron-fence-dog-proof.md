<p>Wrought iron fences provide a classic and elegant look to any property. They are also incredibly strong, making them an ideal choice for protecting your yard from potential intruders, including your four-legged family member. Making your wrought iron fence dog proof is not as hard as you might think. With just a few simple steps, you can make sure that your beloved pooch stays safe and secure. Read on to learn how.</p>

<h2>Choose the Right Type of Fence</h2>

<p>When installing a wrought iron fence, it is important to choose the right type for your needs. Wrought iron comes in several different styles, so it is important to select the one that best fits the size and temperament of your dog. If you have a larger or aggressive dog, you may want to consider a solid panel or picket fence. These types of fences are more difficult for your pet to climb over and can also help to contain any digging behavior. For smaller or less active dogs, an ornamental design is a great choice. These designs are not only aesthetic but can also be more difficult for your pet to climb.</p>

<h2>Check the Gaps</h2>

<p>Once you have selected the right fence style, you will need to ensure that there are no gaps in the fence that your pet can squeeze through. Wrought iron fences can be installed with either horizontal or vertical pickets and panels. It is important to check that the pickets are spaced close enough together so that your pet canâ€™t fit through. If there are gaps between the pickets, you may want to consider adding a mesh or chain link fence to the inside of the fence to help fill in the gaps.</p>

<h2>Install a Topper</h2>

<p>Another way to make your wrought iron fence dog proof is to add a topper. Toppers are installed on the top of the fence and can help to prevent your pet from jumping or climbing over the fence. They can be made of wood, metal, or plastic, and come in a variety of designs to suit any style of fence. Toppers can also be used to add extra height to your fence, making it even more difficult for your pet to jump or climb over.</p>

<h2>Add a Gate</h2>

<p>Finally, installing a gate on your wrought iron fence can help to keep your pet from escaping. Gates come in a variety of styles and can be opened and closed with a simple latch or lock. They can also be used to give you access to the yard or garden, without having to worry about your pet getting out. Gates can be made of wood, metal, or plastic, and can be designed to match your existing fence.</p>
