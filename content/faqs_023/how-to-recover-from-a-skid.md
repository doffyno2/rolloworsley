<p>Have you ever been driving and suddenly felt your car begin to skid? It can be a terrifying experience, but it is important to stay calm and take the right steps to recover from a skid. Skidding can happen for a variety of reasons, from bad weather to slippery roads to mechanical issues. In this article, weâ€™ll discuss what you need to know about recovering from a skid, so you can stay safe on the roads.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Skid?</h2>

<p>Skidding is caused when a driver applies too much pressure on the brakes or accelerates too quickly, leading to a loss of traction. This is often compounded by bad weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or ice, which can make the roads more slippery. Skidding can also be caused by mechanical issues, such as worn brakes, or tire problems, such as under- or over-inflated tires. If the issue is a mechanical one, it is important to get it repaired as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>How to Recover From a Skid</h2>
