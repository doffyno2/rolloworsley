If you own a 2017 Ford Edge and the maintenance light has come on, it’s time to reset it. This light alerts you when it’s time to have your Edge serviced and checked for any necessary repairs. Resetting this light is easy and can be done in only a few minutes. 

<h2>Checking the Oil Level</h2>

The first step to resetting the maintenance light on your 2017 Ford Edge is to check the oil level. You’ll need to make sure that your oil level is at the proper level. To check your oil level, locate the dipstick and remove it. Wipe it off with a clean cloth and reinsert it. Pull it out again and check the oil level. If it’s too low, add more oil until it’s at the proper level. 

<h2>Confirm Your Oil Change</h2>

Once you’ve confirmed that your oil level is at the proper level, you’ll need to confirm that your oil change has been completed. If you recently had your oil changed, your mechanic should have reset the maintenance light on your 2017 Ford Edge. If not, you’ll need to do it yourself. 

<h2>Resetting the Maintenance Light on a 2017 Ford Edge</h2>

Now that you’ve checked your oil level and confirmed your oil change, it’s time to reset the maintenance light on your 2017 Ford Edge. To do this, you’ll need to locate the reset button. This can be found under the dash on the driver’s side. Once you’ve located the reset button, press and hold it for several seconds. You should hear a beep and the maintenance light should be reset. 

<h2>Checking the Battery Level</h2>

The next step is to check the battery level on your 2017 Ford Edge. This is an important step because a low battery can cause your maintenance light to come on. To check the battery level, open the hood and locate the battery. Check the level with a voltmeter and make sure it’s at the proper level. If the battery is low, charge it until it’s at the proper level. 

<h2>Checking the Coolant Level</h2>

Once you’ve checked the battery level, you’ll need to check the coolant level. This will prevent your Edge from overheating and ensure that your maintenance light stays reset. To check the coolant level, locate the coolant reservoir and check the level. If it’s low, add more coolant until it’s at the proper level. 

<h2>Checking the Tire Pressure</h2>

The last step to resetting the maintenance light on your 2017 Ford Edge is to check the tire pressure. This is important to do because low tire pressure can cause your Edge to run inefficiently and cause the maintenance light to come on. To check the tire pressure, use a tire gauge to check each tire. Make sure that each tire is at the proper pressure. If a tire is low, add more air until it’s at the proper pressure.
