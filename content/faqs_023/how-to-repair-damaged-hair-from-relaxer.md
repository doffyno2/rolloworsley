<h2>What is a Relaxer?</h2>

A relaxer is a type of hair product used to straighten extremely curly or kinky hair. It is often used by those of African-American descent, but can also be used by those of other ethnic backgrounds. Relaxers contain a variety of chemical ingredients, including sodium hydroxide, guanidine hydroxide, and ammonium thioglycolate, that break down the protein bonds of the hair shaft and make it easier to straighten.

<h2>What are the Risks of Relaxer Use?</h2>

Relaxers can be extremely damaging to the hair and scalp. Over time, the harsh chemicals can weaken the hair shaft, leading to breakage, split ends, and dryness. In addition, the scalp can become irritated and inflamed from the chemicals, leading to redness, itching, and even hair loss. People who use relaxers should always follow the directions on the product label, and use the lowest possible strength to minimize the risk of damage.

<h2>What are the Signs of Relaxer Damage?</h2>

The most common signs of relaxer damage are dryness and breakage. Hair that has been over-treated with a relaxer may appear dull and have split ends. It may also feel brittle and have a straw-like texture. In more severe cases, the hair may have a brittle, crunchy texture and may be prone to breakage.

<h2>How to Repair Damaged Hair from Relaxer</h2>

The first step in repairing damaged hair from relaxer is to cut off any split ends and damaged pieces. This will help reduce the amount of damage done to the hair and will help the hair look healthier. Next, it is important to use a deep-conditioning treatment once or twice a week to help nourish and hydrate the hair. This can be done with a store-bought deep conditioning treatment or a homemade mixture of natural oils such as coconut oil or olive oil.

<h2>How to Protect Hair from Further Damage</h2>

To protect the hair from further damage, it is important to use a mild shampoo and conditioner and to avoid using heat styling tools such as blow dryers, flat irons, and curling irons. In addition, it is important to use a heat protectant spray before using any heat styling tools. It is also important to avoid using relaxers more frequently than the product label recommends. 

<h2>Tips for Healthy Hair</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Eating a balanced diet that contains plenty of fruits, vegetables, and protein.</li>
