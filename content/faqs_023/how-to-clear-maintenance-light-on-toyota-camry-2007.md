This article will explain how to clear the maintenance light on a Toyota Camry 2007.</p>

<h2>What is the Maintenance Light?</h2>

<p>The maintenance light, also known as the service light, is a warning light that appears on the dashboard of some cars. It is designed to alert the driver that maintenance is needed to keep the car in good condition. The maintenance light is typically yellow or orange and has a symbol that resembles a wrench. It is important to take care of the maintenance light as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the car.</p>

<h2>What Does the Maintenance Light Mean?</h2>

<p>When the maintenance light appears on the dashboard, it typically means that the car needs to be serviced. This could be anything from an oil change to a more complex repair such as replacing a timing belt. The exact cause of the light will depend on the car and the issue that needs to be addressed. If the light is flashing, this usually indicates a more serious issue and should be addressed immediately.</p>
