<p>The Thule Urban Glide 2 is a great stroller for both parents and kids. It's lightweight, easy to maneuver, and has a smooth ride. It's also designed to be durable and long-lasting. But, like any other product, it needs to be used properly to ensure its longevity. Here's how to open the Thule Urban Glide 2.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Unfold the Stroller</h2>

<p>To start, you'll need to open the stroller. This is done by pushing down on the handle of the stroller and lifting up the frame. The frame should unlock and then you can pull it back, allowing the stroller to unfold. You can then pull the handle up and the stroller will be ready to use.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Adjust the Handlebar</h2>

<p>Once the stroller is unfolded, it's time to adjust the handlebar height. This can be done by pulling up on the handlebar and then pushing it back down. You can also adjust the angle of the handlebar by twisting the knob on the side. Make sure the handlebar is at a comfortable height that's easy for you to reach.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Secure the Harness</h2>

<p>Next, you'll need to secure the harness straps to the stroller. This is done by threading the straps through the slots on the stroller. You'll then need to secure the straps by pulling the straps tight and snapping the buckles into place. Make sure the harness is secure and comfortable for your child.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Attach Accessories</h2>

<p>Once the stroller is open and secured, you can attach any accessories you may have. These can include a cup holder, a snack tray, or a parent console. All of these accessories should attach to the stroller easily with the help of snaps and straps.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Check the Brakes</h2>

<p>Finally, you'll want to check the brakes on the stroller. This can be done by engaging the brakes and then pushing the stroller forward. The brakes should hold the stroller in place, preventing it from moving. If the brakes don't seem to be holding, you may need to adjust them.</p>
