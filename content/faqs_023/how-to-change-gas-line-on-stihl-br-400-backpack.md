At some point, you may need to replace the gas line on your Stihl BR 400 backpack blower. Whether it’s due to wear and tear, a kink, or a break, having a functioning gas line is essential for the safe operation of your blower. In this article, we’ll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to change the gas line on your Stihl BR 400 backpack blower.

<h2>What You’ll Need</h2>

Before you get started, there are a few tools and supplies that you’ll need to have on hand. The supplies you’ll need are:

<ul>
<li>New gas line</li>
<li>Hose clamps</li>
<li>Needle-nose pliers</li>
<li>Screwdriver</li>
<li>Wire cutters</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

Once you’ve gathered the necessary supplies, you can begin the process of changing the gas line on your Stihl BR 400 backpack blower.

<h3>Step 1: Remove the Old Gas Line</h3>

The first step is to remove the old gas line from the blower. To do this, use a screwdriver to remove the hose clamps from the ends of the old gas line. Once the clamps are off, pull the old gas line off of the blower.

<h3>Step 2: Cut the New Gas Line</h3>

Next, use the wire cutters to cut the new gas line to the appropriate length. Make sure that the length is long enough to reach from the fuel tank to the engine.

<h3>Step 3: Attach the New Gas Line</h3>

Once the new gas line has been cut to the appropriate length, it’s time to attach it to the blower. First, attach one end of the gas line to the fuel tank. Use the hose clamps to secure the gas line in place. Then, attach the other end of the gas line to the engine. Make sure that the connection is secure.

<h3>Step 4: Test the Connection</h3>

Once the new gas line has been attached to the blower, it’s important to test the connection to make sure that it’s secure. To do this, use a pair of needle-nose pliers to lightly tug on the connection. If the connection is secure, it should not move. If it does move, then the connection is not secure and needs to be tightened.

<h3>Step 5: Start the Blower</h3>

Once the connection has been tested, it’s time to start the blower. Turn the ignition switch to the “on” position and pull the starter cord. The blower should start up without any problems. If it does not start, check the connection again to make sure it’s secure.
