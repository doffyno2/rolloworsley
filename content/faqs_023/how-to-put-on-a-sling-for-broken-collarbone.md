How to Put on a Sling for a Broken Collarbone

Having a broken collarbone is a painful injury, and it can take weeks to months to heal. The use of a sling is recommended to help alleviate the pain and provide support while the fracture heals. It is important to learn how to put on a sling correctly to ensure that the shoulder joint is properly stabilized while the fracture is healing. This article will provide detailed instructions on how to properly put on a sling for a broken collarbone.

<h2>What is a Broken Collarbone?</h2>
A broken collarbone, also known as a clavicle fracture, is a break or crack in the collarbone, which is located between the shoulder blades. The collarbone is the only bone that connects the shoulder joint to the rest of the body, so a broken collarbone can cause significant pain and discomfort. The most common cause of a broken collarbone is a fall on the shoulder or an impact to the shoulder area.

<h2>What is a Sling?</h2>
A sling is a device used to provide support and immobilize an injured arm or shoulder. It is typically made of cloth or a lightweight fabric and is used to keep the arm in a comfortable position while the injury is healing. The sling helps to reduce pain, promote healing, and prevent further injury.

<h2>When Should a Sling be Used?</h2>
A sling should be used when the injury is severe enough that a person needs to immobilize the shoulder joint. It is especially beneficial for people with a broken collarbone as it helps to prevent further damage and allows the fracture to heal properly.

<h2>What Type of Sling Should be Used?</h2>
There are several different types of slings available, including:

<ul>
  <li>A standard sling – This type of sling is designed to provide support for the arm, keeping it in a comfortable position while the injury heals. It is typically made of cloth or a lightweight fabric.</li>
  <li>A figure-of-eight sling – This type of sling is designed to provide greater support for the arm as well as greater comfort. It is usually made of a thicker, more durable fabric than the standard sling.</li>
  <li>A shoulder immobilizer – This type of sling is designed to provide total immobilization of the shoulder joint. It is typically made of a stiffer fabric and includes straps and buckles to ensure that the arm is securely held in place.</li>
</ul>

The type of sling that should be used will depend on the severity of the injury. For most people with a broken collarbone, a standard sling or a figure-of-eight sling will be sufficient.
