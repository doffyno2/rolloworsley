How to Get Rid of Dead Cells for a Healthier Body



Dead cells are a normal part of our body’s life cycle. As new cells are created, older cells die off and are replaced by new, healthier cells. This is a normal and healthy process that helps keep our body functioning optimally. Unfortunately, dead cells can accumulate in our body, leading to health problems and decreased immunity. In this article, we’ll look at the causes of dead cells and how to get rid of them for a healthier body.
