    <li>A new riding lawn mower blade</li>
    <li>Protective gloves</li>
    <li>A flathead screwdriver</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Disconnect the Battery</h2>

<p>The first step in changing a Toro riding lawn mower blade is to disconnect the battery. This will prevent any electrical shorts from occurring when you are working on the blade. To do this, simply unplug the battery from the mower and set it aside in a safe place. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Loosen the Blade Bolt</h2>

Once the bolt is loose, you can remove it with your hands.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Remove the Old Blade</h2>
