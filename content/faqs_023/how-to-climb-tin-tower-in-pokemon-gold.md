<p>Pokemon Gold is an incredibly popular role-playing game, the first in the second generation of the Pokemon series. It was released in 1999 and quickly became a hit with fans.

The process is a bit tricky, so here's a guide to help Pokemon Gold players climb the Tin Tower.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Obtain the Rainbow Wing</h2>

Once you've beaten them, you'll be able to climb to the top of the tower and face Ho-Oh.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Defeat Ho-Oh</h2>

<p>Once you reach the top of the Tin Tower, you'll encounter the legendary Pokemon Ho-Oh. To defeat it, you'll need to use a combination of powerful attacks and careful strategy.
