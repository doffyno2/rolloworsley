<p>If you have an unused door in your home, you may want to consider hiding it. Unused doors can be an eyesore and a distraction from the design of your room. Fortunately, there are some easy and effective methods for hiding an unused door that will help you create a more cohesive and attractive space. Read on to learn how to hide an unused door in a room.</p>

<h2>1. Cover the Door with Curtains, Drapes, or Blinds</h2>

<p>One of the simplest and most effective ways to hide an unused door is to cover it with curtains, drapes, or blinds. All three of these window treatments are available in a wide range of colors and styles, so you can easily find something that will match the decor of your room. You can also choose from sheer, blackout, or other types of curtains, depending on how much privacy you want. Curtains, drapes, and blinds are also relatively easy to install and maintain, so this is a great option if you don’t want to go through the hassle of painting or wallpapering the door.</p>

<h2>2. Install a Folding Screen</h2>

<p>Another option for hiding an unused door is to install a folding screen. Folding screens come in many different styles, so you can easily find one that coordinates with the design of your room. They are also relatively easy to install and move around if needed. Plus, you can use the screen to add a bit of privacy if you don’t want people to see through the door.</p>

<h2>3. Paint or Wallpaper the Door</h2>

<p>If you are up for a bit of a DIY project, you can also paint or wallpaper the door. This is a great option if you want to match the color or pattern of the door to the other walls in the room. Painting or wallpapering the door may be a bit of a hassle, but it is a good way to make the door blend in with the rest of the room. Plus, you can always repaint or wallpaper the door if you decide you don’t like the look.</p>

<h2>4. Hang a Piece of Artwork</h2>

<p>Hanging a piece of artwork on the door is another great way to hide an unused door. Artwork can be an effective way to make the door blend in with the other walls in the room. Plus, artwork is an easy and inexpensive way to add some color and texture to the room. Just make sure to choose a piece of artwork that is the same size or slightly larger than the door so it won’t look too small.</p>

<h2>5. Put Up Shelves</h2>

<p>If you have some extra space around the door, you may want to consider putting up some shelves. Shelves are great for storing books, knick-knacks, and other items. Plus, they can make the door look less noticeable, as the shelves will draw the eye away from the door. Just make sure to choose shelves that coordinate with the other furniture in the room.</p>
