<p>Mount McKinley, also known as Denali, is the highest mountain peak in North America, located in the Alaska Range. Its height is 20,310 feet above sea level and is the third-highest mountain peak in the world. It is located in the Denali National Park and Preserve, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Alaska. The mountain is so high that it is sometimes visible from hundreds of miles away on a clear day.</p>

<h2>How Was Mount McKinley Measured?</h2>

<p>The exact height of Mount McKinley has been subject to debate for centuries. In the early 19th century, various measurements were taken by explorers and geographers. However, the first definitive measurement was taken in 1952 by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Using aerial photography and trigonometry, the USGS determined that the mountain stood at 20,320 feet.</p>

<p>Since then, there have been several other surveys and measurements taken, including several by the National Park Service. The most recent survey, conducted in 2013, determined that the mountain stands at 20,310 feet. This figure is the one most commonly accepted and is the one used by the USGS.</p>

<h2>What Is the Prominence of Mount McKinley?</h2>

<p>The prominence of a mountain is the vertical distance between its summit and the lowest contour line surrounding it. This figure is important because it gives an indication of how dominant a mountain is in its region. The prominence of Mount McKinley is 18,000 feet, making it the most prominent mountain peak in North America and the second most prominent in the world.</p>

<h2>What Is the Geology of Mount McKinley?</h2>

<p>Mount McKinley is a stratovolcano, a type of volcano that is formed by multiple layers of hardened lava, ash, and other materials. It is part of the Alaska Range, which is composed of several active and dormant volcanoes. The mountain has a large caldera at its summit, which is the result of a large eruption that occurred in the late Pleistocene Epoch.</p>

<h2>What Is the Climate of Mount McKinley?</h2>

<p>Mount McKinley has a cold, alpine climate with temperatures ranging from -75 degrees Fahrenheit in winter to +50 degrees Fahrenheit in summer. The mountain is usually blanketed in snow and ice throughout the year, with the snowpack reaching depths of up to 100 feet. The weather on the mountain can be extremely unpredictable and dangerous due to its high altitude and the frequent storms that pass through the area.</p>

<h2>What Are the Surrounding Mountains?</h2>

<p>Mount McKinley is located in the Alaska Range and surrounded by several other mountain peaks. The most prominent of these include Mount Foraker, Mount Huntington, Mount Barrille, and Mount Deborah. These mountains are all part of the Denali National Park and Preserve, and provide excellent opportunities for mountaineering and other outdoor activities.</p>
