<p>PUBG, also known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, is a popular battle royale game that has taken the gaming world by storm.

One of the unique features of PUBG is the ability to use vehicles to traverse the map quickly. Players can control cars, vans, and even bikes to quickly get around the map. However, one of the most difficult and impressive maneuvers a player can pull off is controlling a bike in the air. So, how can you pull off this tricky move? Read on to learn how to control bike in air in PUBG.</p>

<h2>Tips to Control Bike in Air in PUBG</h2>

<p>The ability to control a bike in the air is a difficult maneuver to pull off, but it is possible with practice. Here are some tips to help you learn how to control bike in air in PUBG:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find a high spot: The first step to controlling a bike in the air is to find a high spot on the map. This could be a hill, a building, or even a ramp. The higher you are, the more time you will have to control the bike.</li>
  <li>Look for a flat landing spot: Once you have found a high spot, you need to look for a flat landing spot. This should be a flat area with no obstacles that could stop the bike or cause it to crash. This could be a field, a flat road, or an open area.</li>
  <li>Position the bike: Once you have found a good spot to launch the bike, you need to position the bike. Make sure the bike is facing the direction of the landing spot and that the bike is on an angle that will help it maintain its speed and trajectory in the air.</li>
  <li>Accelerate: Once the bike is positioned, start accelerating. The faster you accelerate, the more time you will have to control the bike in the air. Make sure you do not accelerate too much, as this could cause the bike to overshoot the landing spot.</li>
  <li>Lean back: As you accelerate, you need to lean back on the bike. This will help you maintain your balance as you jump and will also help you control the bike in the air.</li>
  <li>Control the bike: Once you are in the air, you need to control the bike. This is easier said than done, as the bike will be affected by the wind and other factors. You need to make small adjustments to the bike to keep it on course and ensure it lands safely.</li>
  <li>Land safely: Once you have landed, make sure to slow down the bike and come to a complete stop. This will ensure you do not crash or roll over.</li>
</ul>
