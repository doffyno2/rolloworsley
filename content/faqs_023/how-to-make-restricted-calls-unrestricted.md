<p>Restricted calls are a common occurrence in many countries and regions, and they can be extremely frustrating. Fortunately, there are several ways to make restricted calls unrestricted. This article will explore all the different ways to make restricted calls unrestricted and provide tips and tricks to help you make the most of your phone's capabilities.</p>

<h2>What are Restricted Calls?</h2>

<p>Restricted calls are phone calls that are blocked by the network provider because of certain restrictions. These restrictions can be based on geographical area, network provider, or a combination of both. When a call is restricted, it will not go through and the caller will be unable to make contact. This can be extremely frustrating and inconvenient, especially if the person you are trying to contact is located in a different region or country.</p>

<h2>How to Make Restricted Calls Unrestricted</h2>

<p>There are several ways to make restricted calls unrestricted. The most common is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN is a secure tunnel that encrypts data and routes traffic through a different server than the one that is used for regular internet access. This allows for calls to be made to different regions or countries without having to worry about being blocked. It also ensures that the person you are calling is not able to trace the call back to your location.</p>

<h3>Using a VoIP Service</h3>

<p>VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol, and it is a technology that allows for voice calls to be made over the internet. Using a VoIP service is a great way to make restricted calls unrestricted. VoIP services allow for calls to be made to any region or country in the world without having to worry about being blocked. They also provide high-quality audio and video, so the person you are calling can still hear you clearly. The only downside is that VoIP services usually require a subscription fee.</p>

<h3>Using a Voice Call App</h3>

<p>Another way to make restricted calls unrestricted is to use a voice call app. There are many apps available that allow for voice calls to be made to any region or country in the world without having to worry about being blocked. Some of the most popular voice call apps include Skype, WhatsApp, and Viber. All of these apps offer free voice calls, but they may require a subscription fee for premium features.</p>

<h3>Using a Local Phone Number</h3>

<p>Using a local phone number is another way to make restricted calls unrestricted. If you know the phone number of the person you are trying to call, you can purchase a local phone number for that region or country and use it to make the call. This way, the person on the other end will not be able to trace the call back to your location. This method is not as secure as using a VPN or a voice call app, but it is still a viable option.</p>
