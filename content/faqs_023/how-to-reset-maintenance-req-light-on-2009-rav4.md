<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Maintenance Required (or “MAINT REQD”) light on the dashboard of a 2009 Toyota Rav4 is designed to remind the vehicle’s owner that regular maintenance needs to be performed. This light will come on periodically to remind the driver to have their Rav4 serviced. If it is not reset, the light will come on again at the predetermined interval. The Maintenance Required light will also come on if the vehicle is low on oil, or if there is a problem with the oil system. Fortunately, resetting the light is a relatively easy process.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Access the Maintenance Required Menu</h2>

<p>The first step in resetting the Maintenance Required light is to access the menu in which the light can be reset. To do this, turn the ignition switch to the “ON” position (without starting the engine). Then, press the “TRIP” button on the dashboard. This button is located near the odometer. Pressing the button will bring up the “MAINT REQD” menu. The menu will be displayed in the instrument cluster, which is the area around the speedometer and other gauges.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Scroll to the Reset Button</h2>

<p>The second step is to scroll to the “RESET” button. This button is located at the bottom of the “MAINT REQD” menu. To scroll to it, press the “TRIP” button again. Once the “RESET” button is highlighted, press the “TRIP” button again to select it. This will bring up a confirmation message. Select “YES” to confirm that the light should be reset.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Exit the Menu</h2>

<p>The final step is to exit the “MAINT REQD” menu. To do this, press the “TRIP” button again. This will bring up the “MAINT REQD” menu again. Press the “TRIP” button one more time to exit the menu. At this point, the Maintenance Required light should be reset.</p>
