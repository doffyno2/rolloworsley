<p>Changing the oil on a Husqvarna riding mower is a necessary part of regular maintenance and will help ensure your machine runs smoothly and efficiently. It can be done in a few easy steps and requires only basic tools. Read on to learn how to change the oil on a Husqvarna riding mower. </p>

<h2>What You'll Need</h2>
<p>Before you begin, gather the following items:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Oil drain pan</li>
<li>2-3 quarts of oil</li>
<li>Husqvarna oil filter</li>
<li>Oil filter wrench</li>
<li>Funnel</li>
<li>Phillips-head screwdriver</li>
<li>Socket wrench set</li>
<li>Paper towels</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 1: Prepare the Mower</h2>
<p>Before beginning the oil change process, be sure to park your mower on a level surface and turn off the engine. Allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes before beginning. Once you have taken these precautions, you can move on to the next step. </p>

<h2>Step 2: Remove the Oil Drain Plug</h2>
<p>Using a socket wrench, carefully remove the oil drain plug located near the bottom of the engine. Place the oil drain pan underneath the plug and allow the oil to drain out completely. This may take several minutes. Once the oil has drained out, replace the plug and securely fasten it with the socket wrench. </p>

<h2>Step 3: Replace the Oil Filter</h2>
<p>Locate the oil filter on the side of the engine and use an oil filter wrench to remove it. Wipe away any residual oil and then replace the filter with a new one. Be sure to use a Husqvarna oil filter to ensure a proper fit. Tighten the filter with the filter wrench and then wipe away any excess oil. </p>

<h2>Step 4: Add New Oil</h2>
<p>Using a funnel, carefully add two to three quarts of oil to the engine. Be sure to check your owner's manual for the recommended type of oil for your mower. Once you have added the oil, check the dipstick to ensure the oil level is correct. If it is not, add more oil until the level is correct. </p>

<h2>Step 5: Reattach the Oil Drain Plug</h2>
<p>Once you have added the oil and verified the level is correct, you can reattach the oil drain plug. Use a socket wrench to secure the plug and make sure it is tight. </p>

<h2>Step 6: Clean Up</h2>
<p>Once you have finished changing the oil, clean up any residual oil or debris. Wipe down the engine and surrounding area with paper towels and then dispose of them in an appropriate manner. </p>

<h2>Step 7: Test Run</h2>
<p>Before you put your mower back into service, it's a good idea to run it for a few minutes and check for any leaks. If you don't see any, your oil change is complete and you're ready to go. </p>
