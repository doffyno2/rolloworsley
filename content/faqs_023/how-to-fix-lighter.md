<p>Having a lighter that won't light can be a major inconvenience, as well as a safety hazard. If you’re in a pinch, it’s important to be able to rely on your lighter to get the job done. Fortunately, there are a few steps you can take to fix a lighter that won’t light.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Check the Butane Level</h2>

<p>If your lighter won’t ignite, the first thing you should do is check to make sure the butane fuel level is full. If the butane level is low, you’ll need to refill it before you can use the lighter. To do this, turn the lighter upside down and unscrew the bottom to access the butane chamber. After refilling the chamber, replace the bottom and test the lighter to make sure it works.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Clean the Ignition System</h2>

<p>If the butane level is full and the lighter still won’t ignite, you may have an issue with the ignition system. To fix this, you’ll need to clean the system. Start by unscrewing the lighter and using a cotton swab to clean the surface of the flint wheel. You can also use a cotton swab to clean the lint filter that’s located in the ignition system. After you’ve cleaned the lint filter and flint wheel, replace the lighter and test it to make sure it works.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Replace the Flints</h2>

<p>If the ignition system is clean but the lighter still won’t light, you may need to replace the flints. To do this, unscrew the bottom of the lighter and remove the flint chamber. Replace the flints with new ones and reassemble the lighter. After reassembling the lighter, test it to make sure it works.</p>
