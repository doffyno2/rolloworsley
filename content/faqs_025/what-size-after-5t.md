<h2>Understanding the Different Sizes for Children's Clothing</h2>

Shopping for children's clothing can be a daunting task. With seemingly endless sizes, it can be hard to determine what size comes after 5T. To make it easier, it helps to understand the different sizes that are available and how they correspond to the age and height of a child. 

<h3>Sizing for Babies and Infants</h3>

When it comes to babies and infants, sizes range from newborn to 24 months. Newborn clothing is typically for babies up to 3 months old, while sizes 3 months to 12 months are designated as infant sizes. Within this range, clothing typically indicates the age of the child it is intended for, such as 6 months, 9 months, etc. 

<h3>Sizes for Toddlers</h3>

When it comes to toddlers, sizes begin at 2T and go up to 5T. The "T" stands for "toddler" and is used to designate the age range of the clothing. Depending on the brand, 2T generally corresponds to a child who is two years old and up to 34 inches tall, while 5T corresponds to a child who is five years old and up to 42 inches tall. 

<h3>Sizes After 5T</h3>

Once a child has outgrown 5T, they will move onto sizes 6, 7, and 8. These sizes are typically designated as "boys" or "girls" and can vary depending on the retailer. Generally, sizes 6 and 7 are for children who are 6 and 7 years old and between 42 and 51 inches tall. Size 8 is for children who are 8 years old and between 51 and 54 inches tall. 

<h3>Plus Sizes for Children</h3>

In addition to the standard sizes for children, some retailers also carry plus sizes for children. Plus sizes for children typically range from 10P to 14P. The "P" stands for plus and is used to designate clothing for children with larger measurements than those found in the typical sizes. Plus sizes are generally for children who are between 54 and 70 inches tall and between 10 and 14 years old.
