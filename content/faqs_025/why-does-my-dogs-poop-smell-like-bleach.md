<p>If you've ever noticed that your dog's poop smells like bleach, you may be wondering what could be causing it. After all, it's not normal for a pet's poop to smell like a cleaning product! Fortunately, there are a few potential explanations for why your dog's poop might smell like bleach.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Dog's Poop to Smell Like Bleach?</h2>

<p>The most common cause of a dog's poop smelling like bleach is a condition known as “chloridorrhea”.

<p>Chloridorrhea can be caused by a number of different things, including eating food that has been contaminated with chlorine or other harsh chemicals, drinking water that has been contaminated with chlorine, or even a diet that is high in chlorine-containing foods.</p>
