<p>When it comes to choosing the most suitable shirt size for a man of 5'10, there are a few key things to keep in mind. The body type of the individual, the type of shirt and the fit of the garment all play an important role in finding the right size shirt. Without taking each into consideration, it can be difficult to find the most comfortable and flattering fit.</p>

<p>The height of a person is just one factor to consider when it comes to finding the right size shirt for a man of 5'10. The body type of the individual, including the width of their shoulders, chest and waist, should also be taken into account. For example, a man of 5'10 with a slender build may need a different size shirt than a man of the same height who has a muscular physique. It is also important to consider the type of shirt that is being purchased. Some shirts, such as polo shirts or dress shirts, may have different sizing than t-shirts or sweatshirts.</p>

<p>In addition to body type and shirt type, the fit of the shirt should also be taken into consideration when selecting the right size. There are three main types of fits: slim-fit, regular-fit and loose-fit. Slim-fit shirts are typically more fitted, while regular-fit and loose-fit shirts are less fitted. A man of 5'10 may find that a slim-fit shirt is the best option for his body type, while a man of the same height who has a larger frame may prefer a regular-fit or loose-fit shirt for a more comfortable fit.</p>

<p>Taking all of the factors into consideration, a man of 5'10 should generally purchase shirts in a size medium. This size is generally the most flattering and comfortable fit for a man of 5'10, as it allows for a fitted look without being too tight. Of course, if the individual has a larger or smaller frame, or if a different type of shirt is being purchased, then a different size may be necessary. It is important to try on a few different sizes to ensure that the shirt fits comfortably and looks flattering.</p>
