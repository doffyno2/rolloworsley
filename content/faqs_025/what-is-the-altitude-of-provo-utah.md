Provo, Utah is a beautiful city located in northern Utah in the Wasatch Front region. It is the third largest city in the state and the second most populous county in the entire country. It is also known for its stunning landscapes and its vibrant culture and economy. But what is the altitude of Provo Utah?

The average elevation of Provo is 4,551 feet above sea level. This makes it the second highest city in the United States after Denver, Colorado. It is situated in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, just south of the Wasatch Range. This makes for a stunning view of the surrounding valley, as well as the snow-capped peaks of the mountains.

The altitude of Provo is important for a number of reasons. For one, it helps to keep the city cooler in the summer months. This helps to keep the air quality better, which is beneficial for those who suffer from allergies or asthma. It also helps to keep the city warmer in the winter months, which can help to make the city a more comfortable place to live.

In addition to the altitude of Provo, there are other factors that can affect the temperature and air quality of the city. The altitude, combined with the city's proximity to the Wasatch Range, can make it difficult to predict temperatures. This is because the mountains can block out the sun's rays, making it cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. 

Another factor that plays a role in the city's air quality is its location in the valley. The air in the valley is generally more polluted than the air in other areas of the state. This is because of the large number of industries located in the area. These industries release pollutants into the air, which can cause health problems for residents.

Finally, the altitude of Provo also affects the amount of precipitation that the city receives. As with other areas of the state, the higher the altitude, the more precipitation the city receives. This can help to keep the city's water supply healthy, as well as help to keep the city's trees and plants healthy and growing.
