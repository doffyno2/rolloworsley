Possums are small nocturnal marsupials that are found in many parts of the world, including Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Possums are omnivorous, meaning they will eat both plant and animal matter. But this begs the question: will possums eat dog poop?

<h2>Do Possums Eat Dog Poop?</h2>

The answer is yes, possums may eat dog poop if they come across it. Possums are opportunistic eaters, meaning they will take advantage of any food source they come across, including dog poop. While it's not their preferred food source, they may eat dog poop if it's the only thing available.

<h2>What Do Possums Usually Eat?</h2>

Possums are omnivores, so they will eat both plant and animal matter. In the wild, possums mainly eat fruits, vegetables, and insects. They are also known to eat small birds and mammals, as well as eggs and carrion. In urban areas, possums may eat pet food, garbage, and compost.

<h2>Are Possums Dangerous?</h2>

Possums can be dangerous, as they are known to carry diseases and parasites. They are also known to attack small pets, such as cats and dogs. If a possum is found in a residential area, it is best to contact a wildlife specialist to safely remove it. 

<h2>How Can I Keep Possums Away From My Home?</h2>

There are a few things you can do to keep possums away from your home:

<h3>1. Clean Up After Your Pets</h3>

The first and most important step is to make sure you clean up after your pets. This means picking up any waste they leave behind and disposing of it properly. This will make your yard less attractive to possums, as they won't have any food sources to attract them.

<h3>2. Seal up Any Openings</h3>

Possums can enter your home through small openings, so it's important to seal up any openings you may find. This includes holes in walls, under porches, and in the roof. If you can't seal the opening yourself, contact a professional to help.

<h3>3. Don't Leave Out Food</h3>

Possums are attracted to food, so don't leave out any food that they can access. This includes pet food and garbage. Make sure to store pet food indoors and keep garbage cans sealed.

<h3>4. Install Motion-Activated Lights</h3>

Motion-activated lights are another way to keep possums away from your home. The lights will startle the possums and make them more likely to stay away.
