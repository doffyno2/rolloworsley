<p>Folgers is an iconic American brand of coffee that has been around for more than a century. It is one of the most recognizable names in the coffee industry and is a popular choice among coffee drinkers. However, some people have noticed that there is an unpleasant odor to Folgers coffee that resembles the smell of dog waste. This unpleasant odor has caused some people to avoid Folgers altogether, and the company has taken steps to address the issue.</p>

<h2>What Causes the Smell?</h2>

<p>The unpleasant odor that is associated with Folgers coffee is caused by a combination of factors. One of the primary factors is the type of beans that are used to make the coffee. Folgers coffee is made with Arabica beans, which have a higher oil content than other types of beans. The oils in these beans can give off an unpleasant smell when they are roasted and brewed.</p>

<p>Another factor that contributes to the smell of Folgers coffee is the way it is brewed. Folgers coffee is brewed using a drip method, which can cause the oils in the coffee to become concentrated. This can lead to a more intense smell than other brewing methods.</p>

<p>Finally, Folgers coffee is often stored in plastic containers. These containers can trap the oils in the coffee, which can lead to an even more intense smell when the coffee is poured out.</p>

<h2>What Can Be Done About the Smell?</h2>

<p>There are several steps that can be taken to reduce the unpleasant odor associated with Folgers coffee. The first step is to ensure that the coffee is stored properly. Storing the coffee in an airtight container will help to keep the oils in the coffee from becoming too concentrated. Additionally, the container should be kept away from direct sunlight and heat.</p>

<p>Another step that can be taken to reduce the smell of Folgers coffee is to use a different brewing method. French presses and cold brew methods can produce coffee that has less of an odor than drip brewing. Additionally, using a higher-quality coffee bean can also reduce the smell.</p>

<p>Finally, using a paper filter when brewing Folgers coffee can also help to reduce the smell. The paper filter will help to trap the oils in the coffee and prevent them from becoming too concentrated.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Folgers Coffee?</h2>

<p>Despite the unpleasant odor that is associated with Folgers coffee, it still has several benefits that make it a popular choice among coffee drinkers. The first benefit is that Folgers coffee is inexpensive. It is one of the most affordable brands of coffee on the market, making it an attractive option for those on a budget.</p>
