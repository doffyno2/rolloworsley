Peacocks are one of the most iconic and beautiful birds in the world. With their vibrant display of feathers and impressive mating dances, they are sure to turn heads in any corner of the globe. But what is the life cycle of these majestic creatures? Let’s take a look.

<h2>The Egg</h2>

The life of a peacock begins with the egg. Peacocks typically lay between two and five eggs at a time, and the eggs typically hatch after an incubation period of around 25 to 28 days. The eggs are usually a light yellowish-brown color and are relatively small, measuring around 4.5 cm in diameter.

<h2>The Hatchling</h2>

When a peacock egg hatches, the hatchling is a small, delicate creature that is covered in soft, downy feathers. At first, the baby peacock is dependent on its mother for warmth and protection, but as it grows older it begins to become more independent.

<h2>The Juvenile</h2>

As the juvenile peacock grows, its feathers start to become more colorful and vibrant. The juvenile peacock also begins to exhibit more of the behaviors that are associated with adult peacocks, including displaying its feathers in a show of dominance and performing its famous mating dance.

<h2>The Adult Peacock</h2>

Once a peacock reaches adulthood, it is typically between two and three years old. Adult peacocks are much larger than juveniles, and they are also much more colorful. They also have a much larger tail, which they use to display their feathers in order to attract potential mates.

<h2>Mating and Reproduction</h2>

When a peacock is ready to mate, it will perform its famous mating dance in order to attract a mate. Peacocks typically mate for life, and the female will lay a clutch of eggs every year.

<h2>Life Span</h2>

The average lifespan of a peacock is between 10 and 20 years, although some peacocks have been known to live much longer. Peacocks typically reach sexual maturity at around two years old.
