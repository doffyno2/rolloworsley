Survivorman is the nickname given to Les Stroud, a Canadian filmmaker, survival expert, and musician. A three-time Gemini Award winner, he is best known as the creator, writer, producer, director, and star of the television series Survivorman. Throughout his career, he has been teaching, entertaining, and inspiring audiences around the world, using his extensive knowledge of wilderness survival and bushcraft to educate and entertain. 

<h2>Early Life and Education</h2>

Les Stroud was born on October 20, 1961, in Toronto, Ontario. He grew up in the small town of Haliburton, Ontario and spent much of his childhood outdoors, learning about the natural world. He also developed a passion for music at an early age, and he started playing guitar and singing when he was just seven years old. 

At the age of 16, Les moved to Toronto to pursue his musical career. He attended college there and studied music, but then decided to pursue a career in outdoor education.

The show was an instant hit and is now in its tenth season. In each episode, Les is dropped into a remote location and left alone for seven days, with no food, water, or shelter.

During his journey, he teaches viewers about the local wildlife and plants, as well as how to build shelter and find food.
