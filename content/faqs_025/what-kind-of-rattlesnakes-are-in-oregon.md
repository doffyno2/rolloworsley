Rattlesnakes are some of the most feared and misunderstood snakes in the United States. In Oregon, there are three species of rattlesnakes: the Northern Pacific Rattlesnake, the Western Rattlesnake, and the Great Basin Rattlesnake. In this article, weâ€™ll discuss what to expect from these three species, their habitats, and how to safely interact with them. 

<h2>Northern Pacific Rattlesnake</h2>

The Northern Pacific Rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus oreganus) is the most widely distributed rattlesnake in Oregon. It can be found in the western parts of the state, including the Coast Range, the Willamette Valley, and the Cascade Range. This species is usually between two and three feet in length, and has a distinct pattern of blotches or crossbands on its back. The Northern Pacific Rattlesnake is usually gray or olive in color, with yellow or tan bands.

<h2>Habitat</h2>

The Northern Pacific Rattlesnake prefers habitats that are dry and rocky, such as canyons, hillsides, and rocky outcrops. They are also often found near streams and rivers, as they prefer moist habitats. They also like to inhabit areas of dense vegetation, such as brushy fields and woodlands. 

<h2>Behavior</h2>

The Northern Pacific Rattlesnake is a nocturnal species, meaning that it is most active at night. During the day, they tend to hide in cracks and crevices in rocks, or in burrows in the ground. They are also known to use abandoned mammal burrows as their resting places. 

<h2>Diet</h2>

The Northern Pacific Rattlesnake feeds mainly on small mammals, such as mice, voles, and chipmunks. They will also feed on lizards, amphibians, and birds. 

<h2>Western Rattlesnake</h2>

The Western Rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis) is the second most widely distributed species in Oregon. This species is usually between two and four feet in length, and has a distinct pattern of blotches or crossbands on its back. The Western Rattlesnake is usually gray or olive in color, with yellow or tan bands.

<h2>Habitat</h2>

The Western Rattlesnake prefers habitats that are dry and rocky, such as canyons, hillsides, and rocky outcrops. They are also often found near streams and rivers, as they prefer moist habitats. They also like to inhabit areas of dense vegetation, such as brushy fields and woodlands. 

<h2>Behavior</h2>

The Western Rattlesnake is a nocturnal species, meaning that it is most active at night. During the day, they tend to hide in cracks and crevices in rocks, or in burrows in the ground. They are also known to use abandoned mammal burrows as their resting places. 

<h2>Diet</h2>

The Western Rattlesnake feeds mainly on small mammals, such as mice, voles, and chipmunks. They will also feed on lizards, amphibians, and birds.

<h2>Great Basin Rattlesnake</h2>

The Great Basin Rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus lutosus) is the rarest species of rattlesnake in Oregon. This species is usually between two and three feet in length, and has a distinct pattern of blotches or crossbands on its back. The Great Basin Rattlesnake is usually gray or olive in color, with yellow or tan bands.

<h2>Habitat</h2>

The Great Basin Rattlesnake prefers habitats that are dry and rocky, such as canyons, hillsides, and rocky outcrops. They are also often found near streams and rivers, as they prefer moist habitats. They also like to inhabit areas of dense vegetation, such as brushy fields and woodlands. 

<h2>Behavior</h2>

The Great Basin Rattlesnake is a nocturnal species, meaning that it is most active at night. During the day, they tend to hide in cracks and crevices in rocks, or in burrows in the ground. They are also known to use abandoned mammal burrows as their resting places. 

<h2>Diet</h2>

The Great Basin Rattlesnake feeds mainly on small mammals, such as mice, voles, and chipmunks. They will also feed on lizards, amphibians, and birds. 

<h2>What to Do If You Encounter a Rattlesnake?</h2>

If you encounter a rattlesnake, it is important to remain calm and give the snake plenty of space. It is also important to remember that rattlesnakes are not aggressive, and will only bite if they feel threatened. If you do find yourself close to a rattlesnake, the best thing to do is to slowly and calmly move away from the snake. 

<h2>How to Avoid Rattlesnakes?</h2>

The best way to avoid rattlesnakes is to be aware of their habitats and to stay away from areas where they are likely to be found. It is also important to watch where you step when hiking or walking in areas where rattlesnakes are common. When camping, it is also important to keep food and garbage away from the campsite, as this can attract rodents and other small mammals, which in turn may attract rattlesnakes.
