New York is one of the world's most vibrant cities, and it frequently experiences a variety of celestial events. One of the most popular of these events is an eclipse, and New Yorkers often wonder what time the eclipse will occur in their city.

<h2>What is an Eclipse?</h2>

An eclipse is a natural phenomenon that occurs when the moon passes directly between the sun and the Earth, casting a shadow on the surface of the Earth. The most common type of eclipse is a solar eclipse, in which the moon blocks the sun’s light. During a lunar eclipse, the moon passes into the Earth’s shadow, creating a reddish tint. 

<h2>When Does an Eclipse Occur in New York?</h2>

The time of an eclipse in New York depends on the type of eclipse. Solar eclipses typically occur twice a year and last for a few minutes. Lunar eclipses, however, occur more frequently, and last for several hours. 

<h2>What Time is the Eclipse in New York?</h2>

The exact time of an eclipse in New York depends on the type of eclipse, as well as the specific location in the city. For example, the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017 began at 1:30pm EDT in New York City, and lasted for just over two minutes. 

<h2>How to View an Eclipse in New York?</h2>

Eclipses can be viewed from anywhere in New York City, as long as the sky is clear and the sun is not blocked by buildings or trees. It is important to remember that the sun is extremely bright, and it can damage your eyes if you look directly at it. Therefore, it is important to use proper eye protection, such as eclipse glasses, when viewing an eclipse.

Lastly, it is important to use a UV or IR filter to protect the camera’s sensor.
