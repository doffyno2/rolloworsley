Goggles are a type of eyewear designed to protect the eyes from harmful UV rays. They come in a variety of styles, shapes, and tints. Some goggles feature lenses with VLT, or visible light transmission, which is a measurement of how much light is allowed to pass through the lens. In this article, we'll discuss what VLT is and how it affects the visibility of your goggles.

<h2>What is VLT?</h2>

VLT stands for visible light transmission. It is a measure of how much light is allowed to pass through the lens of a pair of goggles. The higher the VLT, the more light is allowed to pass through and the brighter your vision will be. Generally, VLT values range from 0-100%, with the higher the percentage, the more light is allowed to pass through. 

<h2>How Does VLT Affect Visibility?</h2>

VLT is an important factor in determining how much light is allowed to pass through the lens of your goggles and, in turn, how well you can see. A higher VLT will allow more light to pass through, making your vision brighter. Conversely, a lower VLT will block more light, reducing the amount of overall visibility. 

<h2>What Types of Goggles Have Different VLT Levels?</h2>

Different types of goggles will have different VLT levels. For example, skiing goggles typically have a higher VLT than snowboarding goggles. Skiing goggles tend to have a VLT of around 80-90%, whereas snowboarding goggles typically have a VLT of around 30-50%. 

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of High VLT Goggles?</h2>

High VLT goggles are beneficial for a variety of reasons. For starters, they provide better visibility in low light conditions, such as foggy weather. They also allow more light to pass through the lenses, improving overall vision. Additionally, they are less likely to cause eye fatigue due to their ability to reduce the amount of strain on your eyes.

<h2>What Are The Benefits Of Low VLT Goggles?</h2>

Low VLT goggles have a variety of benefits, too. For starters, they provide greater protection from UV rays, which can be damaging to your eyes. They also provide increased clarity and definition in bright conditions, making them ideal for snowboarding and other activities where bright conditions are common. Additionally, they often have a more stylish look than high VLT goggles.

<h2>What Are The Best Goggles For Different Activities?</h2>

The best goggles for different activities will depend on the conditions in which you plan to use them. For skiing, a high VLT lens is typically recommended due to its ability to provide better visibility in low light conditions. For snowboarding, a low VLT lens is typically recommended due to its ability to provide increased clarity and definition in bright conditions.
