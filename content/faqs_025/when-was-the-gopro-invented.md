At a young age, Woodman was exposed to the world of business and became fascinated with the idea of creating and selling products. After graduating from college, he traveled around the world and had several ideas for businesses, but none of them were successful.</p>

<p>In 2002, Woodman had an idea for an accessible and affordable action camera that could be used by anyone. He called it the GoPro, and he received funding from friends and family to launch the company. Woodman was the CEO of GoPro for many years until 2017, when he stepped down and was replaced by current CEO Nicholas Woodman.</p>

<p>In 2006, GoPro released its first digital camera, the Digital Hero 3. It was a much more advanced camera than the first model, with a 3 megapixel sensor and an improved LCD screen. It could record video at up to 1280x960 resolution, and it was the first GoPro camera to be able to take still photos.
