Have you ever wondered what number has 21 zeros? This question may seem like a silly one, but it is actually an important question in mathematics. To answer it, we must first understand what a zero is and how it relates to numbers.

A zero is a placeholder in a number. It indicates that there is nothing else in the number. For example, the number 10 has one zero in it. The number 100 has two zeros. The number 1,000 has three zeros, and so on.

When we talk about a number with 21 zeros, we are talking about a very large number. The number is called a googol, and it is written as 1 followed by 100 zeros. A googol is the largest number with a single name that has been given to it.

The term googol was coined by a nine-year-old boy named Edward Kasner in 1938. He was asked by his nephew to come up with a name for a very large number. He was inspired by the word "googolplex," which is a number with a googol of zeros. 

A googol is an incredibly large number. To put it into perspective, if you wrote out the number one followed by 100 zeros, it would take up several pages of paper. It would also take around 10 days to count from one to the googol. 

So, what number has 21 zeros? The answer is one followed by 21 zeros. This number is called a sextillion and is written as 1 followed by 21 zeros. It is a very large number, but it is not nearly as large as a googol.

<h2>What Is a Sextillion?</h2>

A sextillion is a very large number. It is written as 1 followed by 21 zeros. To put it into perspective, if you wrote out the number one followed by 21 zeros, it would take up several pages of paper. It would also take around one day to count from one to the sextillion.

A sextillion is a number that is used in the scientific and financial communities. It is often used to describe large amounts of money, such as the national debt of a country. It is also used to describe very large distances, such as the distance from Earth to the nearest star outside of our solar system. 

<h2>What Is a Googol?</h2>

<h2>How Big Is a Sextillion Compared to a Googol?</h2>

A sextillion is much smaller than a googol. A sextillion is written as 1 followed by 21 zeros, while a googol is written as 1 followed by 100 zeros. This means that a googol is more than 4,500 times larger than a sextillion.

<h2>How Is a Sextillion Used in Everyday Life?</h2>

A sextillion is often used in the scientific and financial communities. It is often used to describe large amounts of money, such as the national debt of a country. It is also used to describe very large distances, such as the distance from Earth to the nearest star outside of our solar system.
