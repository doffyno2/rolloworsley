<p>CO2 cartridges are a type of pressurized cylinder that contains carbon dioxide. They are used in a variety of applications, from paintball guns to bicycle pumps, and even to carbonate beverages. While CO2 cartridges are a convenient and easy-to-use source of gas, they can be dangerous and should be handled with care. In this article, we’ll discuss what to do with CO2 cartridges once you’ve used them.</p>

<h2>Disposing Of Used CO2 Cartridges</h2>

<p>The first step in disposing of used CO2 cartridges is to make sure they are completely empty. If you’re not sure, you can weigh them on a kitchen scale or balance. If they’re still full, they will be heavier than when they were empty. Once you’ve determined that the cartridges are empty, you can safely dispose of them.</p>

<p>The best way to dispose of used CO2 cartridges is to take them to a recycling center. Most municipalities have a recycling center that accepts used CO2 cartridges. You can usually find the nearest recycling center by searching online or by calling your local trash removal company. You can also find recycling centers that accept used CO2 cartridges through the Earth911 website.</p>

<p>If there’s no recycling center near you that accepts used CO2 cartridges, you can also dispose of them in your regular trash. However, you should never throw a full or partially-filled CO2 cartridge in the trash as it could be dangerous. You should also make sure to keep CO2 cartridges away from heat and flame, as they can explode if exposed to high temperatures.</p>

<h2>Recharging CO2 Cartridges</h2>

<p>If you’d rather not discard your used CO2 cartridges, you can also recharge them. Recharging CO2 cartridges is a simple process that can save you money in the long run. The process involves refilling the cartridge with a pressurized gas, such as carbon dioxide or nitrogen.</p>

<p>The process of recharging CO2 cartridges requires special equipment and should only be done by a trained professional. You can find companies that specialize in recharging CO2 cartridges by searching online or by asking at your local paintball shop. Before recharging your CO2 cartridge, make sure to weigh it on a kitchen scale or balance to make sure it is empty.</p>

<h2>Safety Tips For Handling CO2 Cartridges</h2>

<p>CO2 cartridges can be dangerous if not handled properly. Here are a few safety tips to keep in mind when handling CO2 cartridges:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Always wear protective eyewear and gloves when handling CO2 cartridges.</li>
    <li>Never store CO2 cartridges in direct sunlight or near heat.</li>
