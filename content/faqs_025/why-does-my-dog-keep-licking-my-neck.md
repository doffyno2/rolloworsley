We’ve all experienced it at some point: the feeling of your pup giving you a big, wet, slobbery lick on the neck. It can be both gross and adorable at the same time, so it’s no wonder why we ask ourselves, “Why does my dog keep licking my neck?”

There are a few different explanations as to why your pup may be licking your neck. In this article, we’ll go over some of the most common explanations, as well as provide some tips for curbing this behavior in the future.

<h2>Why Does My Dog Lick My Neck?</h2>

Generally speaking, it’s likely that your pup is licking your neck because they’re showing affection. Dogs will often lick the people they love to show that they care. It’s a sign of affection that’s been passed down from their canine ancestors, who licked the faces of their packmates to show that they were part of the same family.

Another possible reason why your pup is licking your neck is because they’re trying to get your attention. Some pups will lick their owners’ necks in order to gain their attention and be rewarded with some affection.

Finally, it’s also possible that your pup is licking your neck because of a medical issue. If your pup has any medical issues such as skin allergies, you should bring them to the vet to see if they have any underlying health issues that could be causing this behavior.

<h2>How Do I Stop My Dog From Licking My Neck?</h2>

If you’d like to stop your pup from licking your neck, the best way to do so is to redirect their attention to something else. Every time they start to lick your neck, try to give them a treat or toy to distract them. This will help them learn that the behavior is not acceptable and that they will be rewarded for engaging in other activities.

It’s also important to make sure that you’re not inadvertently encouraging your pup to lick your neck. If you’re petting them and they start licking your neck, try to move away and ignore the behavior. This will help them understand that the behavior is not acceptable.

Finally, it’s important to make sure that your pup is getting enough exercise and mental stimulation. Dogs that don’t get enough physical and mental stimulation can become bored and restless, and may start displaying inappropriate behaviors such as licking their owners’ necks. Make sure you’re providing your pup with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation to keep them healthy and happy.
