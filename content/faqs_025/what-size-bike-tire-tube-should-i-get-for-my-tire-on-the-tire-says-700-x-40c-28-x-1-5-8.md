Bike tires are an essential part of any bicycle. Without properly inflated tires, you won’t be able to ride your bike safely and comfortably. That’s why it’s important to make sure that you have the right size bike tire tube for your bike’s tire. 

When it comes to bike tire tubes, the main thing to consider is the size of your tire. Most bike tires will have a size written on the sidewall, usually in the form of “700 x 40c” or “28 x 1.5/8”. This information will tell you what size bike tire tube you need. 

<h2>How to Read Tire Size</h2>

Reading tire size is relatively simple. The first number is the diameter of the tire in millimeters. The second number is the width of the tire in millimeters. The letter “c” stands for the French term “centième” which means one hundredth. So a 700 x 40c tire means that the diameter is 700 millimeters and the width is 40 millimeters. 

The second type of tire size is usually seen on older or vintage bikes. This size is usually written in the form of “28 x 1.5/8”. The first number is the diameter of the tire in inches. The second number is the width of the tire in inches. So a 28 x 1.5/8 tire means that the diameter is 28 inches and the width is 1.5/8 inches.
