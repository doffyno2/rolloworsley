<p>Kennel cough is an infection that affects the respiratory systems of dogs. It is caused by a combination of bacteria and viruses, and can be spread through contact with other dogs or from the environment. While it is not life-threatening, it can be very uncomfortable for your pet and lead to further complications if left untreated. As such, it is important to take steps to prevent kennel cough, as well as to provide your dog with the proper nutrition to help him recover from the infection.</p>

<h2>What is Kennel Cough?</h2>

<p>Kennel cough is a respiratory infection that affects the trachea and bronchi of dogs. It is caused by a combination of bacteria and viruses, and can be spread through contact with other dogs or from the environment. The main symptom of kennel cough is a dry, hacking cough.

<h2>What to Feed Your Dog With Kennel Cough</h2>
