<p>Lincoln is a name that is synonymous with US history. He is one of the most famous presidents to ever serve in the White House, and his iconic image is recognizable the world over. But perhaps the most striking thing about Lincoln is his distinctive white hair. But why does Lincoln have white hair?</p>

<p>The most accepted explanation for Lincoln's white hair is that it was a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Lincoln's father, Thomas, had a head full of white hair by the time he was in his 30s, so it is likely that Lincoln inherited his father's genes and was predisposed to premature graying. However, it is also likely that the stress Lincoln endured throughout his lifetime, including his presidency, played a role in his hair turning white.</p>

<p>Historians have noted that Lincoln's hair began to turn white shortly after his election to the presidency in 1860. It is likely that this was due to the immense stress and pressure he experienced in the coming years as he presided over a country divided by civil war. As the war dragged on, Lincoln's hair became more and more white until it was completely white by the time of his assassination in 1865.</p>

<h2>What Other Factors May Have Contributed to Lincoln's White Hair?</h2>

<p>In addition to genetics and stress, there are a few other factors that may have contributed to Lincoln's white hair. One of these is nutrition. During the time of Lincoln's presidency, the nutrition available was far inferior to what we have available today. This lack of nutrition could have had an effect on Lincoln's hair, causing it to turn white prematurely.</p>

<p>Another factor that could have contributed to Lincoln's white hair is smoking. Lincoln was known to be a smoker, and the nicotine in the cigarettes he smoked could have had an effect on his hair turning white. In addition, the toxic chemicals in cigarettes can damage hair follicles, resulting in premature graying.</p>

<h2>What Other Famous People Have White Hair?</h2>

<p>Lincoln isn't the only famous person with white hair. In fact, there are a number of other famous people who have gone grey or white. Some of the most notable include Winston Churchill, Albert Einstein, Bill Clinton, and George Washington.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill was known for his distinctive white hair, which he had from a young age. Albert Einstein was also known for his white hair, although his was more of a salt and pepper color. Bill Clinton was famously photographed with a full head of white hair during his presidency, and George Washington was known for his white hair in the later years of his life.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, why does Lincoln have white hair? The most accepted explanation is that it was a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Lincoln's father had a head full of white hair by the time he was in his 30s, so it is likely that Lincoln inherited his father's genes and was predisposed to premature graying. In addition, the immense stress Lincoln endured throughout his lifetime, including his presidency, likely played a role in his hair turning white. Nutrition and smoking could also have been factors in Lincoln's premature graying.</p>
