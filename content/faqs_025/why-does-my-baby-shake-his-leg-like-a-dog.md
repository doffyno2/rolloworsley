<p>If your baby is shaking his or her leg like a dog, you may be concerned and wondering why this is happening. It’s important to understand the different types of movements that can be seen in young children, and how they can be related to different developmental stages. In this article, we will look at why babies shake their legs, and what you and your doctor can do to help. </p>

<h2>What Is Leg Shaking in Babies?</h2>

<p>Leg shaking in babies is often referred to as “shiver-like” movements, because it looks like the baby is shivering or trembling. It typically involves the lower legs, but can sometimes be seen in the arms and feet as well. It is most often seen in babies between the ages of 6 and 12 months, but can also be seen at younger ages. It is more common in boys than in girls.</p>

<h2>What Causes Leg Shaking in Babies?</h2>

<p>Leg shaking in babies is usually caused by a developmental delay in the brain, where the baby is unable to control their movements. It can also be caused by muscle weakness or spasticity, which is when the muscles don’t relax after a contraction. In some cases, it can be caused by neurological disorders such as cerebral palsy or epilepsy. It is important to note that leg shaking in babies is not usually caused by a medical condition, but it can be a sign of one.</p>

If the leg shaking is caused by a developmental delay, your doctor may suggest physical therapy or occupational therapy to help your baby learn how to control their movements. If it is caused by a neurological disorder, your doctor may suggest medications or other treatments to help your baby cope with the condition.</p>

<h2>How Can You Help Prevent Leg Shaking in Babies?</h2>
