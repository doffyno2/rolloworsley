Traveling internationally can be an exciting and rewarding experience, but it can also be a source of stress, especially when dealing with security checks. Travellers can experience delays, extra screening, or even denied boarding in certain situations. To help reduce the potential for discrimination, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has created the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP). This program enables travellers to submit a secure request for redress if they feel they have been unfairly treated by DHS.

<h2>What is the Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP)?</h2>

The Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (TRIP) is a free service provided by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). It is designed to help the DHS resolve cases where travellers feel they have been wrongly delayed or denied boarding, or otherwise treated unfairly. When a traveller submits a redress request, the DHS will review the traveller’s information and, if appropriate, add a redress number to their file. This number is then shared with all DHS components, as well as other federal agencies and international partners, to help ensure that the traveller is not subjected to additional delays, extra screening, or denied boarding.

<h2>Who is Eligible for TRIP?</h2>

Any traveller who feels they have been unfairly treated by DHS when travelling internationally is eligible to submit a redress request through TRIP. This includes, but is not limited to, travellers who have been wrongly delayed or denied boarding, or subjected to extra screening.

<h2>How Do I Submit a Redress Request?</h2>

Submitting a redress request is easy and free. You can submit a request online through the DHS website. Alternatively, you can submit a paper form by mail or fax. You will need to provide your name, address, and other personal information, as well as a detailed explanation of why you feel you have been unfairly treated by DHS.

<h2>What Happens After I Submit a Redress Request?</h2>

Once you have submitted your redress request, it will be reviewed by the DHS. If they feel you have been unfairly treated, they will issue you a redress number, which will be shared with all DHS components, as well as other federal agencies and international partners. This number will help ensure that you are not subjected to additional delays, extra screening, or denied boarding.

<h2>How Long Does it Take to Get a Redress Number?</h2>

The DHS typically takes about 45 days to process a redress request. However, the exact timeframe can vary depending on the complexity of the case and the volume of requests the DHS is receiving. 

<h2>What Should I Do if I Don’t Receive a Redress Number?</h2>

If you don’t receive a redress number from the DHS after 45 days, you should contact them directly to follow up on your request. You can call the DHS TRIP office at 1-877-428-7746 or email them at TRIP@dhs.gov.

<h2>What Should I Do if I Receive a Redress Number?</h2>

If you receive a redress number, you should provide it to the airline or other transportation provider when you are travelling. This will help ensure that you are not subjected to additional delays, extra screening, or denied boarding.
