<p>Embalming is a process used to preserve the dead by preventing their bodies from decaying. In the United States, the practice of embalming dates back to the Civil War. During the war, thousands of soldiers died, leaving their families and loved ones with no way to preserve the bodies for burial. This prompted the development of the modern embalming process, which has been in use for over 150 years.</p>

<p>The earliest known use of embalming in the United States was in 1867, when a Union surgeon named Thomas Holmes was asked to preserve the body of President Abraham Lincoln. Holmes used a combination of chemicals and salts to preserve Lincoln's body, and his success led to the wider adoption of embalming in the United States. As the Civil War drew to a close, the practice of embalming grew in popularity, eventually becoming a widely accepted practice.</p>

<p>The practice of embalming saw a major shift in the early 20th century, when the modern embalming process was developed. The process involved injecting a mixture of chemicals and preservatives into the body, which helped to slow down the rate of decay. This process allowed funeral homes to offer families a way to preserve the bodies of their loved ones for longer periods of time. This development marked the beginning of the modern embalming industry, which has become a major part of the funeral industry.</p>

<p>As the practice of embalming grew in popularity, so did regulations and laws concerning its use. In the United States, embalming is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and various state boards of health. These regulations are in place to ensure that embalming is done in a safe and sanitary manner, and that the bodies of the deceased are treated with respect. Regulations also ensure that funeral directors and embalmers are properly licensed, and that the chemicals used in the embalming process are safe.</p>

<p>Today, embalming is a widely accepted practice in the United States. It is used to help families preserve the memories of their loved ones, and to ensure that their bodies are treated with respect. Embalming is also used to help preserve the bodies of those who have died from infectious diseases, such as cholera and tuberculosis. As the practice of embalming continues to evolve, it is likely that regulations and laws concerning its use will also change.</p>
