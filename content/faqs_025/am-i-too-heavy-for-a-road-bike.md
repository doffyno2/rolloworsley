Am I Too Heavy for a Road Bike?


Road biking is a great way to get around and stay fit. But if you are a heavier rider, you may be wondering if you’re too heavy for a road bike. The good news is that there are road bikes available that can accommodate heavier riders. In this article, we’ll discuss whether you are too heavy for a road bike and the best road bikes for heavier riders.

<h2>Are You Too Heavy for a Road Bike?</h2>

In general, the answer to this question is no - you are not too heavy for a road bike. However, the type of road bike you choose will be important.
