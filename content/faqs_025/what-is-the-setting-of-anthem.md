<p>Anthem is a science fiction novella by Ayn Rand, first published in 1938. Set in a dystopian future, it tells the story of one manâ€™s struggle against a totalitarian and collectivist society. The protagonist, Equality 7-2521, is a scientist who discovers electricity and struggles against the oppressive collective, eventually finding freedom and individualism.</p>

<p>The setting of Anthem is an unnamed city in an unspecified future. The oppressive system of government and the collectivist society are described in detail. The city is surrounded by a great wall, and the citizens are instructed to never venture beyond it. They live in collective homes, and travel in collective vehicles. The citizens are referred to as "brothers" and are assigned numbers instead of names. They are taught to put collective interests first and to think and act as a group. It is a stark contrast to the world of individualism and freedom that Equality 7-2521 eventually discovers.</p>

<p>The society in Anthem is highly religious, with a state-sponsored religion that worships the "Great Truth". The citizens are forbidden from speaking the word "I", and are taught to worship the collective as a higher power. This religion is a source of strength for the citizens and gives them a sense of purpose. It also serves to reinforce their loyalty to the state.</p>

<p>The city of Anthem is a dystopia in which individualism is oppressed and collectivism is embraced. The citizens are taught to put the collective before their own interests, and have no sense of freedom or individual identity. Equality 7-2521 discovers the world outside of the city and discovers a world of individualism and freedom. He learns to think for himself and to stand up against the oppressive system.</p>

<h2>What is the Symbolism in Anthem?</h2>

<p>The overall theme of Anthem is individualism and freedom against oppression and collectivism. This is symbolized throughout the novella in many ways. Equality 7-2521 discovers electricity, which symbolizes the power of the individual over the collective. He also discovers the word "I", which is a symbol of his newfound sense of individualism. The tunnel that he digs symbolizes his journey to freedom and his escape from the oppressive society. The Unmentionable Times symbolize a dark period in the past when individualism was repressed, while the Golden One symbolizes the hope of a better future.</p>

<p>The setting of Anthem is also highly symbolic. The great wall that surrounds the city symbolizes the physical and psychological barriers that prevent the citizens from experiencing freedom and individualism. The collectivist society and the state-sponsored religion symbolize the oppressive forces that keep the citizens in line and prevent them from thinking for themselves.
