What is Muhammad Ali?



Muhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr., was one of the most influential figures of the 20th century. He was a three-time world heavyweight boxing champion, an Olympic gold medalist, a civil rights activist, and a philanthropist. Ali is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time and he was known for his outspokenness and his refusal to back down from a fight.

<h2>Early Life</h2>

Muhammad Ali was born in Louisville, Kentucky, on January 17, 1942. His father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr., was a sign painter and baptist minister, and his mother, Odessa Grady Clay, was a housewife. Ali was the oldest of two boys and two girls. His father nicknamed him "Cassius Clay" after the 19th-century abolitionist and politician Cassius Marcellus Clay.

Ali's interest in boxing began when he was 12 years old. He was inspired to become a boxer after his bike was stolen and he vowed to beat up whoever stole it. In 1954, Ali started training with local boxing coach Joe Martin and began competing in amateur fights. In 1960, Ali won the light heavyweight gold medal at the Summer Olympics in Rome.

<h2>Professional Career</h2>

After the Olympics, Ali decided to turn professional. He made his professional debut in October 1960 and won his first 19 fights by knockout. In February 1964, he defeated Sonny Liston to become the world heavyweight champion at the age of 22.

Ali defended his title nine times, including victories over George Foreman, Joe Frazier, and Ken Norton. He also fought in three legendary bouts with Frazier, known as the "Thrilla in Manila". Ali retired from boxing in 1981 with a record of 56-5-0.

<h2>Civil Rights Activism</h2>

In 1964, Ali converted to Islam and changed his name from Cassius Clay to Muhammad Ali. He also became an outspoken advocate for civil rights and racial justice. He was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and refused to be drafted in 1967, citing his religious beliefs. He was arrested, convicted of draft evasion, and stripped of his boxing titles.

However, Ali's conviction was overturned in 1971 and he resumed his boxing career. He became a global symbol of courage and conviction and was widely admired for his brave stance against the war.
