<p>Have you ever felt numbness in your genitals after riding a Peloton? Do you feel like your pelvic floor muscles are not getting proper exercise while riding the Peloton? If so, you may be asking yourself, why?</p>

<p>The reason why your genitals go numb when riding a Peloton but not on the bikes at the gym is because of the different saddle designs. Peloton bikes use a saddle that is designed for a more upright riding position and does not provide adequate support for the pelvic floor muscles. This leads to numbness in the genital area due to the reduced circulation of blood. On the other hand, the bikes at the gym usually have a more traditional saddle that offers adequate support and prevents the pelvic floor muscles from becoming sore or numb.</p>

<p>The lack of support provided by the Peloton saddle often leads to a decrease in the circulation of blood to the pelvic floor muscles. This can cause numbness in the genital area, which can be uncomfortable and even painful. It is important to note that this is not a medical issue and is simply caused by a lack of appropriate support.</p>

<p>In order to prevent numbness in the genital area, riders should choose a saddle that provides adequate support for their pelvic floor muscles. This can be done by adjusting the saddle height, tilt, and angle to ensure that the rider is sitting in a more upright position. Additionally, riders can use a cushion or padding to provide extra support for the pelvic floor muscles.</p>

<p>It is important to note that numbness in the genital area can also be caused by a number of other factors, such as sitting for too long, dehydration, stress, or a medical condition. If you are experiencing numbness in the genital area, it is important to speak to your doctor to rule out any underlying medical conditions.</p>
