Whatever the reason, anglers enjoy the thrill of the hunt and the satisfaction that comes with a successful catch.

One of the most popular forms of fishing is tuna fishing. Tuna is one of the most sought after fish in the world. It is a highly prized catch and can be found in many different parts of the ocean. This makes it an attractive target for anglers looking to catch a big fish.

But what size fishing line do they use on wicked tuna? This is an important question for any angler looking to target this species of fish. In this article, we will look at the different types of line and how to choose the best for tuna fishing.

<h2>What Is Tuna Fishing?</h2>

Tuna fishing, also known as big game fishing, is the practice of targeting large, predatory fish, such as tuna, marlin, swordfish, and others. It is a challenging form of fishing that requires skill, knowledge, and experience.

Tuna fishing is a popular sport in many parts of the world, from the Atlantic, to the Pacific, and even in the Mediterranean Sea. The species of tuna found in these waters vary in size and type, but one thing they all have in common is that they are a challenge to catch.

<h2>Types Of Fishing Line To Use For Tuna Fishing</h2>

When it comes to tuna fishing, the type of line used is very important. The right type of line will help ensure a successful catch and also give anglers the best chance of landing a big fish. There are several different types of line available, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

<h3>Monofilament Line</h3>

Monofilament line is the most popular type of fishing line used for tuna fishing. It is strong, durable, and relatively inexpensive. Monofilament line is also easy to cast, making it ideal for long distance casting.

<h3>Braided Line</h3>

Braided line is a popular choice for tuna fishing. It is strong and thin, making it perfect for long distance casting. The thin diameter also means that it is less likely to be seen by the fish, giving anglers an edge when trying to target tuna.

<h3>Fluorocarbon Line</h3>

Fluorocarbon line is another popular choice for tuna fishing. It is stronger and more abrasion-resistant than monofilament line, making it ideal for targeting bigger fish. Fluorocarbon line is also less visible in the water, making it a great choice for those looking to target tuna.

<h2>What Size Fishing Line To Use For Tuna Fishing?</h2>

When it comes to choosing the right size of line for tuna fishing, anglers should consider the type of line they are using and the size of the tuna they are targeting.

For monofilament line, the general rule of thumb is to choose a line that is at least twice the size of the diameter of the bait. For example, if the tuna bait is 10 millimeters in diameter, then the line should be at least 20 millimeters in diameter.

For braided line, it is recommended to use a line that is at least four times the size of the bait. For fluorocarbon line, the recommendation is to use at least six times the size of the bait.
