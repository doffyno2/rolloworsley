For over a decade, McDonalds sold hot dogs to customers in various locations around the world. However, in the summer of 2019, the fast food chain announced that it would no longer be selling hot dogs in any of its restaurants. This news left many customers wondering why McDonalds would no longer be offering hot dogs and when exactly did the chain stop selling them?

<h2>Why Did McDonalds Stop Selling Hot Dogs?</h2>

There are a few reasons why McDonalds decided to stop selling hot dogs. One of the most commonly cited reasons is that the company felt hot dogs were too difficult to prepare and maintain in a consistent, high-quality manner. The hot dogs had to be cooked to a specific temperature and the buns had to be toasted to the perfect level of crispiness. The hot dogs also had to be served quickly, which was difficult to do while still maintaining the quality that McDonalds is known for.

Another reason McDonalds may have stopped selling hot dogs is because of customer feedback. Many customers didn’t enjoy the taste of the hot dogs, or felt they were too expensive. This could have led McDonalds to decide it was no longer worth it to continue offering the product.
