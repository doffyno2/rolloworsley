<p>When it comes to finding the right size for clothes, shoes and other accessories, it can be a challenge. This is especially true for those shopping for youth-sized items, as the sizing is not always the same as adult sizes. One of the most common questions that shoppers have is, “What is size 7 youth in women's?” The answer isn’t as straightforward as you may think.</p>

<h2>Women's Clothing Sizes</h2>

<p>Women's clothing sizes are not a direct conversion from youth sizes. For example, a women's size 7 is not the same as a youth size 7. Women's sizes are based on the measurement of the bust, waist and hips. A youth size 7, on the other hand, is based on the height and weight of the child. In order to determine what size a youth size 7 would be in women's sizes, you must compare the measurements.</p>

<h2>Youth Clothing Sizes</h2>

<p>Youth clothing sizes are determined by the child's height and weight. A size 7 in youth clothing usually corresponds to a child that is between the ages of 7 and 8 and whose height ranges from 48 to 50 inches and weight from 50 to 60 pounds. This is just a general guideline, however, since there is no universal sizing standard for youth clothing.</p>

<h2>Converting From Youth to Women's Clothing Sizes</h2>

<p>When converting from youth to women's clothing sizes, it is important to take into account the measurements of the bust, waist, and hips. Generally speaking, a youth size 7 would be equivalent to a women's size 6, or a women's size small. Keep in mind, however, that this is only an estimate and that measurements should always be taken to ensure the best fit.</p>

<h2>Why Sizes Vary So Much</h2>

<p>The reason why sizes vary so much between youth and women's clothing is because of the different measurements used to determine sizes. Women's clothing sizes are based on the measurements of the bust, waist and hips, whereas youth sizes are based on the child's height and weight. This can make it difficult to determine what size a youth size 7 would be in women's sizes, but with a little bit of research and measuring, it can be done.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>When trying to determine what size a youth size 7 would be in women's sizes, it is important to take into account the measurements of the bust, waist, and hips. Generally speaking, a youth size 7 would be equivalent to a women's size 6, or a women's size small.
