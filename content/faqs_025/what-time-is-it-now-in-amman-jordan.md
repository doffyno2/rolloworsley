<p>Jordan observes Daylight Saving Time, which means that the clocks are turned forward one hour during the summer months.

<h2>The History of Time Zones in Amman</h2>

<p>The concept of time zones was developed in the 19th century in response to the challenges of coordinating railway timetables across different countries. Before the invention of time zones, local times were based on the position of the sun in the sky. This meant that different cities in different countries experienced different solar times, which could lead to confusion when trying to coordinate timetables.</p>

<p>In 1879, the International Meridian Conference was held in Washington D.C. in order to address this issue. At the conference, it was decided that the world would be divided into 24 time zones, each one 15° of longitude apart. This meant that all cities located in the same time zone would have the same time, regardless of their distance from each other.</p>

<p>Amman was initially part of the BMG time zone, which was based on the mean solar time of the 6° meridian east of Greenwich. This time zone was later replaced by the UTC+2 time zone, which is now observed in Amman.</p>

<h2>Daylight Saving Time in Amman</h2>

<p>Daylight Saving Time (DST) is a system of adjusting the clock forward by one hour during the summer months in order to make the most of the longer days. DST was first introduced in the early 20th century in order to reduce the amount of energy used for lighting and heating during the summer months. In Jordan, DST is observed from the last Sunday in March to the last Sunday in October.</p>

<p>During the summer months, the clocks in Amman are turned forward one hour, meaning that the time in Amman is three hours ahead of UTC. During the winter months, the clocks are turned back one hour, meaning that the time in Amman is two hours ahead of UTC.</p>
