<p>Lisinopril is an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor, used to treat high blood pressure in humans. It can be used to treat other conditions in dogs, such as congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. While it is not FDA-approved for use in dogs, it is sometimes prescribed by veterinarians.</p>

<p>When used in dogs, lisinopril is typically prescribed in doses between 0.1 and 0.5mg per pound of body weight. A 30lb dog would receive 3 to 15mg of lisinopril, far less than the 20mg that would be prescribed for a human.</p>

<p>The key to safely administering lisinopril to your dog is to give the correct dose. Too low a dose may not provide any benefit, while too high a dose can be dangerous. The most important thing to remember is that lisinopril should never be given to a dog without the express permission of a veterinarian.</p>

By blocking ACE, lisinopril helps to relax the blood vessels, which in turn helps to lower blood pressure. This can help to reduce the risk of stroke, heart attack, and other cardiovascular problems.</p>

<p>In addition to reducing blood pressure, lisinopril can also help to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. It can also help to reduce the symptoms of these conditions, such as coughing and difficulty breathing.</p>
