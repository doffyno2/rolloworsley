<p>Pregnancy is a time of tremendous changes in a woman's body, and one of the most common questions is when do hips widen during pregnancy? It's natural to be concerned about your body changing during pregnancy, so understanding when your hips will widen and why can help you feel more prepared for and in control of the situation.</p>

<h2>What Causes Hips to Widen During Pregnancy?</h2>

<p>Hips widen during pregnancy for a number of different reasons. Firstly, hormonal changes cause the body to produce a hormone called relaxin. This hormone is responsible for loosening the joints and ligaments in the body in preparation for childbirth. As the ligaments in the hips loosen, the area naturally widens. This is why the hips may feel looser and more flexible during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Another reason that hips may widen during pregnancy is due to the increase in body weight. As the baby grows, so does the weight of the mother. This can cause the hips to widen to accommodate the extra weight.</p>

Generally, it is most common for hips to begin to widen during the second trimester, typically around the 20th week of pregnancy.
