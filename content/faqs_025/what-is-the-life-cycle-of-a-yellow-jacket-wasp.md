Yellow jacket wasps are a species of wasp found all over the world. They are identified by their black and yellow stripes and are known for their aggressive behavior. They are often found in and around homes, gardens, and parks. Though they can be a nuisance, they are a beneficial insect as they help to control other pest insects. 

<h2>What is the Life Cycle of a Yellow Jacket Wasp?</h2>

The life cycle of a yellow jacket wasp is composed of four distinct stages. The first stage is the egg, which is laid by the female wasp and can take up to two weeks to hatch. The second stage is the larval stage, which occurs when the eggs hatch and the larvae feed on nectar and other insects. During this stage, the larvae are housed in a single cell and will molt several times before entering the next stage. 

The third stage is the pupal stage, which is the resting stage before the wasp emerges as an adult. Here, the pupae are encased in a silken cocoon, which the larvae builds for protection. During this stage, the larvae develop into adult wasps, which will emerge from the cocoon after about two weeks. 

The fourth and final stage is the adult stage, which occurs when the wasp emerges from its cocoon. The adult wasps will form a colony and will feed on nectar, other insects, and carrion for sustenance. The female wasps will continue to lay eggs and the cycle will repeat itself.

<h2>What Do Yellow Jacket Wasps Eat?</h2>

Yellow jacket wasps feed on nectar, other insects, and carrion. They are attracted to sweet foods, such as fruit and flower nectar, and are often found in gardens and other areas with flowering plants. They are also predators and will feed on other insects, such as caterpillars and flies, as well as carrion. 

<h2>Are Yellow Jacket Wasps Dangerous?</h2>

Yellow jacket wasps are aggressive and can be dangerous to humans. They will sting if they feel threatened and can cause severe reactions in some people. If a yellow jacket wasp nest is disturbed, the wasps will swarm and attack. It is important to use caution when near yellow jacket wasp nests and to avoid provoking them. 

<h2>How Can I Keep Yellow Jacket Wasps Away?</h2>

The best way to keep yellow jacket wasps away is to make sure that they don't have access to food and shelter. Keep sweet foods, such as fruit, out of reach and make sure that trash cans are sealed tightly. If a yellow jacket wasp nest is found, it should be removed by a professional pest control company.
