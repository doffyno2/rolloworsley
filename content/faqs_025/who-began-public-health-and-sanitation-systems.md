<h2>What is Public Health?</h2>

<p>Public health is the science of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities. It involves a variety of activities, from prevention and control of infectious diseases to the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Public health professionals work to prevent disease, injury and disability, and promote health and wellness.</p>

<h2>History of Public Health and Sanitation Systems</h2>

<p>The first public health and sanitation systems were developed in ancient societies. In Mesopotamia, the Code of Hammurabi, which dates back to 1754 BCE, contained several measures to keep the population healthy, such as regulations on sewage disposal and bathing. Ancient Egyptians also had a system of public health and sanitation, which included laws regarding sewage disposal, bathing, and the sale of food. </p>

<p>The Romans took the concept of public health and sanitation to a new level with their aqueducts and public baths. The Romans also developed a system of public health and sanitation that included laws regulating the disposal of sewage, bathing, selling food, and the cleanliness of public places.

<p>Public health and sanitation systems continued to develop over the centuries. In the Middle Ages, the Black Death and other plagues led to an increased focus on public health and sanitation. Governments began to pass laws requiring the disposal of sewage and the cleaning of public places. In the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution led to an even greater focus on public health and sanitation, as cities became increasingly polluted and overcrowded.</p>
