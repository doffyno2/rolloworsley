It can be difficult to find clothing that looks good and fits well when you have a larger body type. Shopping for swimwear can be especially daunting when you’re a plus size. But with the right tips and tricks, you can look and feel confident at the beach. Read on for our guide on what to wear to the beach when you’re fat.

<h2>The Best Swimwear for Plus Sizes</h2>

When you’re shopping for swimwear, it’s important to keep in mind that the right suit should flatter your body and make you feel comfortable. There are now many swimwear options available for plus sizes, so don’t settle for a suit that doesn’t fit properly or make you feel good. Here are some tips for finding the right swimsuit:

<h3>Choose a Darker Color</h3>

Darker colors are slimming and can help you feel more comfortable when you’re wearing a swimsuit. If you prefer lighter colors, opt for a solid color instead of a pattern. This will also help to slim your figure.

<h3>Avoid Big Prints</h3>

Prints can be fun, but if you’re self-conscious about your body, it’s best to avoid big prints. Smaller prints can help to break up the body and make you appear slimmer.

<h3>Opt for a Tankini</h3>

A tankini is a two-piece swimsuit that combines a tank top and bikini bottoms. Tankinis are great for plus sizes because they offer more coverage than a traditional bikini. Look for tankinis with a higher waist and thicker straps for extra support.

<h3>Try a Swimdress</h3>

Swimdresses are a great option for plus size women because they provide extra coverage and support. Look for swimdresses with an empire waist, which will help to slim your figure.

<h3>Look for Extra Support</h3>

Plus size swimwear often comes with extra support, such as built-in bras or adjustable straps. This can help to give you extra support and make you feel more comfortable.

<h2>The Best Cover-Ups for Plus Sizes</h2>

Cover-ups are a great way to add extra coverage when you’re at the beach. Look for cover-ups that are made from lightweight, breathable fabrics. Here are some tips for finding the perfect cover-up:

<h3>Choose a Longer Length</h3>

Longer length cover-ups can help to hide your tummy and thighs. Look for cover-ups that hit at mid-calf or ankle length for a more flattering fit.

<h3>Opt for Dark Colors</h3>

Darker colors can help to hide any lumps or bumps and create a slimmer silhouette. Choose a dark color that flatters your skin tone and makes you feel confident.

<h3>Look for Flowy Fabrics</h3>

Flowy fabrics are great for plus sizes because they skim your body without clinging. Look for fabrics like chiffon or georgette, which will help to create a flattering silhouette.

<h3>Avoid Tight Fits</h3>

Tight-fitting cover-ups can be unflattering and uncomfortable. Look for cover-ups that fit loosely and don’t cling to your body.
