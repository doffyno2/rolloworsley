<p>It’s a question that has been asked for centuries – which travels faster, light or sound? In the vacuum of space, light is the clear winner, but what about on Earth? The answer isn’t so simple.</p>

<h2>The Speed of Light</h2>

<p>Light is an electromagnetic wave and, in a vacuum, it travels at an incredibly fast speed of 299,792,458 meters per second, or 186,282 miles per second. That’s fast enough to circle the Earth 7.5 times in just one second!</p>

<h2>The Speed of Sound</h2>

<p>Sound, on the other hand, is a mechanical wave and it’s much slower than light. In air, sound travels at a speed of 340 meters per second, or 1125 feet per second. That’s about a million times slower than the speed of light!</p>

<h2>The Speed of Sound in Different Mediums</h2> 

<p>When it comes to sound, the speed at which it travels depends on the medium it’s travelling through. In air, sound travels at 340 meters per second. In water, it travels at 1,484 meters per second. In steel, it travels at 5,120 meters per second. In other words, the speed of sound can vary depending on the medium it’s travelling through.</p>

<h2>The Speed of Sound in Different Temperatures</h2>

<p>The speed of sound also depends on the temperature of the medium it’s travelling through. The warmer the temperature, the faster the sound travels. In the coldest temperatures, sound travels at 330 meters per second. In the warmest temperatures, sound can travel up to 350 meters per second.</p>

<h2>So Which Travels Faster – Light or Sound?</h2>

<p>In a vacuum, light travels faster than sound. But on Earth, sound can travel faster than light depending on the medium it’s travelling through, and the temperature. Generally speaking, light will travel faster than sound on Earth, but there are exceptions.</p>
