<h2>What is Turo Trip Fee?</h2>

<h2>Why is Turo Trip Fee So Expensive?</h2>

<p>The trip fee is typically a percentage of the total rental cost, so the more expensive the rental, the more expensive the trip fee will be. Turo also takes into account the cost of providing the rental platform and other operational costs. This means that the trip fee covers more than just the cost of renting the car. It also covers the cost of providing the platform, customer service, and other operational expenses.</p>

<p>Turo also charges a fee for its insurance coverage, which is included in the trip fee.
