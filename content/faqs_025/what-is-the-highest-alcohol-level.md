Alcohol, also known as ethanol, is an intoxicating substance found in various types of beverages. It is a central nervous system depressant, meaning it slows down the activity of the brain and body. The level of alcohol in a given beverage is measured in terms of its percentage of alcohol by volume (ABV). The higher the ABV, the more intoxicating the beverage is.

For example, a beer with 5% ABV contains 5% alcohol by volume. The higher the ABV, the more alcohol the beverage contains, and the more intoxicating it will be.
