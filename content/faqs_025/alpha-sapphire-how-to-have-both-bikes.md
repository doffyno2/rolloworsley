<p>Alpha Sapphire is a popular game from the Pokémon series. It follows the same mechanics of the previous games, but with some interesting new features. The game is set in the Hoenn region, and the player has to collect various Pokémon and battle trainers in order to become the Champion of the region. One of the new features of Alpha Sapphire is the ability to have two bikes: the Devon Bike and the Acro Bike. While it might seem difficult to have both bikes at once, it's actually quite simple.</p>

<h2>How to Obtain the Devon Bike</h2>

<p>The first step to obtaining the Devon Bike is to get the Devon Parts from Devon Corporation. After getting the Devon Parts, you need to go to the Rustboro City bike shop and talk to the owner. He will give you the Devon Bike. Then, you need to head to the Slateport City bike shop and talk to the owner there. He will give you the Acro Bike.</p>

<h2>How to Use the Devon Bike</h2>

<p>Once you have the Devon Bike, you can use it to travel around the Hoenn region. You can use the Devon Bike to cross rivers and streams, and also to ride up steep slopes. The Devon Bike also has a special ability, which is the ability to jump over obstacles. You can use this ability to get past obstacles that you can't get past with the Acro Bike. </p>

<h2>How to Use the Acro Bike</h2>

<p>The Acro Bike is a very versatile bike, and it can be used to ride on many different kinds of terrain. You can use the Acro Bike to ride on sand and shallow water, and you can also use it to jump over low walls. The Acro Bike also has a special ability, which is the ability to pedal backwards. This can be used to reach places that you can't reach with the Devon Bike.</p>

<h2>How to Have Both Bikes at Once</h2>

<p>Once you have both the Devon Bike and the Acro Bike, you can have them at the same time. To do this, you need to go to the Cyclist Union in Mauville City.
