<p>Owning a Honda Accord is a great pleasure, and they are known for being reliable and easy to maintain, but even the best cars require regular maintenance to keep them running smoothly. High mileage Honda Accords are no exception, as they can require even more attention as they age. If you own a high mileage Honda Accord, you need to be aware of the maintenance that it needs to keep it running strong for years to come. Here are some of the most important maintenance tasks that you should perform on your high mileage Honda Accord.</p>

<h2>Oil Changes</h2>

<p>Oil changes are one of the most important parts of Honda Accord maintenance, regardless of mileage. It is especially important to change the oil in a high mileage Accord, as older oil can cause the engine to wear out faster. You should have your oil changed every 3,000 to 5,000 miles, depending on the specific type of oil that you use. It is also important to use the same type of oil that your Accord recommends, as this will help keep it running smoothly.</p>

<h2>Tire Rotations</h2>

<p>Tire rotations are also important for Honda Accords, especially high mileage ones. Rotating your tires regularly will help keep them from wearing out prematurely and ensure that they last as long as possible. You should have your tires rotated at least once every 6,000 miles, or more often if you drive in a lot of different conditions or on uneven surfaces. This will help keep your Accord running smoothly and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Brake Inspections</h2>

<p>Brake inspections should also be done regularly on a high mileage Honda Accord. Over time, the brake pads and other components of the brakes can wear down, reducing their effectiveness and making it harder to stop quickly. To ensure that your brakes are working properly, you should have them inspected every 6,000 to 12,000 miles, depending on your driving habits. This will help keep you safe on the road and prevent any major brake problems from occurring.</p>

<h2>Fluid Checks</h2>

<p>Fluid checks are also important for a high mileage Honda Accord. Over time, the fluids in your Accord can become contaminated or worn out, reducing their effectiveness and putting strain on the engine. To ensure that your Accord is running as smoothly as possible, you should have the fluids checked every 6,000 to 12,000 miles. This includes the engine oil, transmission fluid, coolant, and brake fluid.</p>

<h2>Spark Plug Replacement</h2>

<p>Spark plugs are another important part of Honda Accord maintenance. Over time, the spark plugs can become corroded or worn out, reducing their effectiveness and increasing fuel consumption. To keep your Accord running smoothly and efficiently, you should have the spark plugs replaced every 12,000 to 18,000 miles, depending on your driving conditions.</p>

<h2>Timing Belt Replacement</h2>

<p>Timing belt replacement is also important for a high mileage Honda Accord. Over time, the timing belt will wear out and need to be replaced to keep your Accord running smoothly. You should have the timing belt replaced every 60,000 to 90,000 miles, depending on the type of belt and your driving habits.</p>

<h2>Air Filter Replacement</h2>

<p>The air filter in your Honda Accord should also be replaced regularly. Air filters help keep the air clean and reduce engine wear, so you should have it replaced every 12,000 to 15,000 miles. This will help keep your Accord running smoothly and efficiently for years to come.</p>
