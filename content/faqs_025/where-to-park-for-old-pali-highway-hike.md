<p>The Old Pali Highway is one of the most popular hiking destinations in Hawaii. It offers breathtaking views of the Ko’olau Mountains, lush tropical forests, and plenty of opportunities for adventure. But before you can enjoy the beauty of the Old Pali Highway, you need to know where to park. Here’s everything you need to know about parking for the Old Pali Highway hike.</p>

<h2>Finding a Place to Park for Your Old Pali Highway Hike</h2>

<p>Parking for the Old Pali Highway hike can be a bit tricky. While there are several parking options available, they are all limited in one way or another. The most popular spot is the Nu’uanu Pali Lookout, located at the end of the highway. Here, you can find a few dozen parking spots that are available on a first-come, first-serve basis. The lookout is open from 8am to 6pm, so if you plan on doing an early morning hike, you may want to look for alternative parking options.</p>

<p>Another option is the Pali Lookout picnic area, located at the beginning of the Old Pali Highway. The picnic area offers a large open-air parking lot with plenty of space for up to 25 cars. This is a great option for those looking to start their hike early in the morning, as the picnic area is open 24 hours a day. The only downside is that you may have to wait a while for a spot to open up, as the picnic area tends to fill up quickly.</p>

<p>A third option is the Kaneohe District Park, which is located at the midpoint of the Old Pali Highway. The park offers several designated parking spots for hikers, as well as plenty of room for overflow parking. The park is open from 7am to 8pm, so if you plan on getting an early start, you may need to look for alternative parking options.</p>

<p>Finally, there are a few private parking lots located along the Old Pali Highway. These lots are usually owned by local businesses and may charge a fee for parking. However, they are often much more convenient than the other parking options, as they are open 24 hours a day and don’t tend to fill up as quickly.</p>
