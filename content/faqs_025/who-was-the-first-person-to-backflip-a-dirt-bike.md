While the trick has been popularized in recent years, it has a long history. So who was the first person to backflip a dirt bike?</p>

<p>The honor of being the first person to backflip a dirt bike goes to American motocross rider, Mike Metzger. On August 6, 2000, Metzger became the first person to land the trick successfully. It was at the X Games in San Francisco and it was a moment that would change the sport of motocross forever. After Metzger's successful stunt, the backflip quickly became a staple in the sport, with more and more riders performing it in competitions and shows.</p>

<p>Metzger had been practicing the backflip for months before his historic moment. He even had a special ramp built to give him the right angle and speed to pull off the trick.

He took off down the ramp, did a perfect backflip, and landed it perfectly. The crowd erupted in cheers and the trick was immortalized in motocross history.</p>
