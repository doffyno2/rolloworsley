<p>A soak and clean cycle dishwasher is a specialized type of dishwasher that offers an additional cycle to the traditional washing cycle. This cycle is designed to thoroughly clean dishes that have been left in the dishwasher for a long period of time, or dishes that have been exposed to tough and stubborn food debris. The soak and clean cycle uses high temperatures and powerful jets of water to clean and sanitize dishes, leaving them sparkling and ready to use.</p>

<h2>What Does Soaking Do?</h2>

<p>Soaking is a process that helps loosen dried-on food particles that can be difficult to remove. It works by allowing the dishwasher to fill with soapy water, then the water is heated to a temperature that helps soften the food particles. This process can take several minutes or even hours depending on the type of food and the length of time it has been left in the dishwasher.</p>

<h2>What Are the Benefits of a Soak and Clean Cycle?</h2>

<p>The main benefit of a soak and clean cycle is that it helps to thoroughly remove stubborn food debris that traditional washing cycles cannot remove. This type of cycle also helps to sanitize dishes and prevent the growth of bacteria. Soaking dishes can also help to reduce the amount of time needed to clean dishes, as the soaking process helps to loosen the food particles.</p>

<h2>How Does a Soak and Clean Cycle Work?</h2>

<p>The soak and clean cycle works by filling the dishwasher with hot soapy water, then the water temperature is increased to a level that helps to loosen dried-on food particles. The water is then agitated to help loosen the food particles and remove them from the dishes. The water is then drained and the dishes are rinsed with hot water to remove any remaining food particles.</p>

<h2>Do I Need to Use Soap With a Soak and Clean Cycle?</h2>

<p>Yes, it is important to use a dishwashing detergent when running the soak and clean cycle. This is because the detergent helps to break down the food particles and remove them more easily. Without the detergent, the process may take longer and the dishes may not be as clean.</p>

<h2>How Often Should I Run the Soak and Clean Cycle?</h2>

<p>It is recommended to run the soak and clean cycle once a week or as often as necessary. This is especially important if your dishes are exposed to tough and stubborn food debris. If your dishes are exposed to mild food debris, then running the cycle less often is sufficient.</p>

<h2>Are There Any Disadvantages to Using a Soak and Clean Cycle?</h2>
