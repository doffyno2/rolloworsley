<p>The term ‘full moon’ is used to describe the moment when the sun and moon are in perfect alignment, with the moon in its fullest and brightest form. Every month, the full moon is visible in the night sky and it’s typically the most spectacular sight to behold in the lunar cycle. But when is the next full moon in 2021?</p>

<p>The answer lies in the lunar cycle, which is divided into four distinct phases: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter, and new moon. The full moon is the most visible phase of the lunar cycle, and it occurs when the sun and moon are in perfect alignment and the moon is at its fullest and brightest. Depending on the month, the full moon can occur anywhere from two to three times per month.</p>

<h2>How Does the Lunar Cycle Work?</h2>

<p>The lunar cycle is composed of four distinct phases: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, full moon, waning gibbous, last quarter, and new moon.

During the new moon phase, the moon is completely invisible in the night sky, while during the full moon phase, it is fully visible.</p>

<p>The lunar cycle is a result of the gravitational pull exerted by the sun and moon on the earth. The gravitational force of the sun and moon causes the earth to rotate in a slightly tilted manner, which means that the sun and moon appear to move across the sky at different points in the cycle. As the earth rotates, the sun and moon move into different positions, causing the phases of the lunar cycle.</p>
