<p>America’s Next Top Model (ANTM) is a popular reality TV show created by Tyra Banks. The show follows a group of aspiring models as they compete for the title of America’s Next Top Model. Each season, a panel of judges chooses a winner from the contestants, who is then crowned America’s Next Top Model. 

In Cycle 17, the winner was Angelea Preston, who was subsequently disqualified after Tyra Banks and the production team discovered that she had previously worked as an escort. This raised a lot of questions as to why she was allowed to compete in the first place, and why she was disqualified after she was already crowned the winner. In this article, we’ll explore the reasons behind Angelea’s disqualification from America’s Next Top Model Cycle 17. 

<h2>Background Information</h2>

Angelea Preston was a contestant on the seventeenth cycle of America’s Next Top Model, which aired from September 2011 to December 2011. She was crowned the winner in the season finale, but was later disqualified after it was discovered that she had previously worked as an escort. 

At the time, Tyra Banks and the production team had no knowledge of Angelea’s past, and it was only after the finale that they discovered her history. Banks issued a statement explaining her decision to disqualify Angelea and the following explanation was given: “Angelea was aware of our policies and yet she failed to disclose certain information during the application process. As a result, we had to disqualify her.” 

<h2>Reasons For Disqualification</h2>

The primary reason for Angelea’s disqualification was that she failed to disclose her past as an escort. According to the rules of the show, all contestants must disclose any and all information that could potentially affect their eligibility, or disqualify them from the competition. 

In Angelea’s case, her past as an escort was deemed to be a potential conflict of interest, and it was deemed necessary for her to disclose this information during the application process. As she failed to do so, she was disqualified from the competition. 

<h2>Controversy</h2>

Angelea’s disqualification caused a great deal of controversy and debate. Many argued that her disqualification was unfair, and that she should have been allowed to continue in the competition. Others argued that the production team should have done more to verify the information that Angelea provided during the application process. 

Regardless, the rules of the show are clear, and the production team had no choice but to disqualify Angelea. 

<h2>Aftermath</h2>

After Angelea’s disqualification, the runner-up, Allison Harvard, was crowned the winner of America’s Next Top Model Cycle 17. Allison went on to have a successful career in modeling, and has been featured in numerous campaigns and magazines. 

Angelea, on the other hand, was left without a job. She was unable to find work as a model, and ended up working as a waitress. She has since returned to modeling and has been featured in several campaigns and magazines. 

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Angelea Preston was disqualified from America’s Next Top Model Cycle 17 after it was discovered that she had previously worked as an escort. Her disqualification caused a great deal of controversy, but ultimately the production team had no choice but to disqualify her, as she failed to disclose this information during the application process. 

After her disqualification, the runner-up, Allison Harvard, was crowned the winner of America’s Next Top Model Cycle 17. Angelea has since returned to modeling and has been featured in several campaigns and magazines.
