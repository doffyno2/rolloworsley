<p>A Known Traveler Number (KTN) is a unique code assigned to a traveler by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). It confirms that the traveler has been approved to participate in certain programs that are designed to expedite the security screening process. If you have a KTN, it will appear on your government-issued identification card, such as a passport or driver’s license. However, it can be difficult to locate your KTN on your card, so we’re here to help you find it.</p>

<p>A Known Traveler Number (KTN) is a unique identifier assigned to a traveler by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).
