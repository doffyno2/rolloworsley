<p>Hike is a popular messaging and social media application that allows users to send messages, photos, video and audio messages, as well as voice and video calls. It is available on both Android and iOS devices, and is used by millions of people around the world. Hike is known for its unique features, such as its stickers, group chat, and its “BRB” feature.

The acronym “BRB” stands for “Be Right Back.” It is a way for Hike users to quickly let their friends and family know that they will be away for a short period of time, and that they will be “right back” soon. The BRB feature is a great way for users to let their contacts know that they are taking a break from Hike, without having to leave the app or sign out.
