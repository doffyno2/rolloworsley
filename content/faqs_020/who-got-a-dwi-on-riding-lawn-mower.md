It’s true that no one expects to get a DWI on a riding lawn mower, but that is exactly what happened to one man in the state of Minnesota. In October 2019, a man was arrested and charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) for operating a riding lawn mower while under the influence of alcohol. This incident raised several questions about the legalities of operating a riding lawn mower while intoxicated and what the consequences of such an action might be. 

<h2>What Is a DWI? </h2>

A DWI, or Driving While Intoxicated, is a criminal offense that is committed when an individual operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. In most states, including Minnesota, a DWI is considered a serious offense and can result in jail time, fines, and suspension or revocation of a driver’s license. 

<h2>Is Operating a Riding Lawn Mower Considered Driving? </h2>

The answer to this question depends on the laws of the particular state in question. In Minnesota, the laws governing DWI are very clear. According to Minnesota Statute 169A.20, it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. This includes riding lawn mowers, as they are considered motor vehicles under Minnesota law. As such, operating a riding lawn mower while under the influence of alcohol or drugs could result in a DWI charge. 

<h2>What Are the Possible Consequences of a DWI? </h2>

The consequences of a DWI vary from state to state, but in Minnesota, a DWI can result in jail time, fines, community service, and suspension or revocation of a driver’s license. In this particular case, the man was charged with a DWI and was facing up to 90 days in jail, a $1,000 fine, and a one-year license suspension. 

<h2>Is It Possible to Avoid a DWI Charge? </h2>

In most states, including Minnesota, the best way to avoid a DWI charge is to not operate any motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If you are found to be operating a motor vehicle while under the influence, you may be charged with a DWI. Additionally, it is important to note that even if you are not under the influence of alcohol or drugs, it is still against the law to operate a motor vehicle if your blood alcohol content (BAC) is over the legal limit. 

<h2>What Are the Best Practices for Operating a Riding Lawn Mower? </h2>

When operating a riding lawn mower, it is important to always be aware of your surroundings and to use caution.
