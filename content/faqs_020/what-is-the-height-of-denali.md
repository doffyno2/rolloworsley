Denali is the highest mountain peak in North America. Located in south-central Alaska, it is part of the Alaska Range, a subrange of the larger Pacific Coast Ranges.

<h2>History of Denali</h2>

Denali is one of the most iconic mountains in the world. It has a long history of exploration by mountaineers and adventurers dating back to the 19th century. The mountain was first climbed in 1913 by an expedition led by Hudson Stuck, and it has since become one of the most popular destinations for climbers from all over the world.

<h2>Geology of Denali</h2>

Denali is composed of several geologic features, including sedimentary rock, intrusive igneous rocks, and metamorphic rocks. The mountain is composed of sedimentary rocks formed when sediment was deposited in an ancient sea. The sea eventually evaporated, leaving behind sedimentary rocks that were then buried and subjected to extreme pressure and heat. This process caused the sedimentary rocks to become metamorphic rocks.
