The NFL is the premier professional football league in the United States, and it has a long and illustrious history. With the start of the season just around the corner, many fans are gearing up to cheer on their favorite teams, and a lot of those fans will be wearing official NFL merchandise.

<h2>History of the C Patch</h2>

The C patch is a small logo that has been featured on the NFL jersey since 1976. It is a tribute to NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle, who passed away in 1996. The patch was designed by the NFL to honor Rozelle's memory and his contributions to the game of football. The patch features a single letter "C" superimposed over a football-shaped silhouette with a white background.

<h2>Purpose of the C Patch</h2>

The C patch is an important part of the NFL uniform. It serves as a reminder of the contributions that commissioner Pete Rozelle made to the game of football.

It is a reminder that all teams in the league are part of a larger whole, and that no matter their individual differences, they are all united by their love of the game.

<h2>Where It Is Placed</h2>

The C patch is typically placed on the left shoulder of the jersey, just below the player's number. It is usually sewn onto the jersey, but some teams may choose to have it embroidered instead. In either case, the patch serves as a reminder of the legacy of Pete Rozelle and the NFL.

<h2>Variations of the C Patch</h2>
