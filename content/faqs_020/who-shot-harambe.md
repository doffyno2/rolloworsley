The story of what happened that day has been a source of controversy and debate, and the answer to the question “who shot Harambe?” is still being sought. </p>

<p>The incident began when a three-year-old boy fell into the gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo.

<p>The incident has sparked a heated debate as to whether or not the zoo was justified in their decision to shoot and kill Harambe. Animal rights activists argue that the zoo should have done more to save the gorilla’s life, such as using tranquilizers instead of a lethal shot. Others argue that the zoo was simply acting to protect the child, and that the decision to shoot Harambe was the only option. </p>

<p>The incident has also raised questions about the safety of zoos and the protocols that are in place to protect visitors. Some have argued that the zoo should have done more to prevent the situation from occurring in the first place, such as erecting a higher barrier between the public and the animal enclosures. Others have argued that the zoo acted responsibly and that the incident was an unavoidable tragedy. </p>
