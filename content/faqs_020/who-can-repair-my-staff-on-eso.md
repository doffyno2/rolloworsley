<p>Do you need to repair your stuff on Elder Scrolls Online (ESO)? Whether it's a weapon, armor, or jewelry, ESO's robust crafting system makes it possible to repair almost any item, but it can be tricky to figure out how to do it. Luckily, there are a few ways to get your gear back in fighting shape, and this guide will show you the best strategies for repairing your stuff on ESO.</p>

<h2>How Does Item Repair Work?</h2>

<p>In ESO, item repair works in a very simple way. When an item becomes damaged, it loses its effectiveness and can no longer be used. In order to restore an item to its original condition, you must use a Repair Kit on it. Repair Kits can be purchased from vendors, crafted, or found as drops in dungeons.</p>

<p>When you use a Repair Kit on an item, it will restore the item's stats and make it usable again. Note that using a Repair Kit does not restore any enchantments or other bonuses that may have been on the item before it was damaged. Those must be reapplied if desired.</p>

<h2>Repairing Weapons and Armor</h2>

<p>Weapons and armor are the most common items that need repairs in ESO. Fortunately, repairing these items is very easy. All you need to do is purchase a Repair Kit from a vendor or craft one and then use it on the item you wish to repair. It's important to note that Repair Kits can only be used on weapons and armor, not on jewelry.</p>

<h2>Repairing Jewelry</h2>

<p>Jewelry is a bit more complicated when it comes to repairs. Unlike weapons and armor, jewelry requires a different type of Repair Kit to restore it to its original condition. Jewelry Repair Kits can be purchased from vendors or crafted, but they are significantly more expensive than the Repair Kits used for weapons and armor.</p>

<p>In addition, jewelry must be repaired manually. You cannot simply use a Repair Kit on an item and expect it to be restored. Instead, you must activate the Repair Kit and then drag the jewelry item onto the Repair Kit's window to begin the repair process.</p>

<h2>Other Ways To Repair Items</h2>

<p>In addition to using Repair Kits, there are a few other ways to repair items in ESO. The most common is to use the Crafting Stations found in most towns and cities. At these stations, you can repair any item for a small fee. This is a great way to save money if you don't want to buy or craft Repair Kits.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use a Repair Hammer to repair items. Repair Hammers are special tools that can be crafted and used to repair any item without requiring a Repair Kit. However, they are not as efficient as Repair Kits and can only repair one item at a time.</p>
