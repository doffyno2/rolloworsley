When it comes to landscaping around your home, one of the biggest concerns can be safety for your pets. Dogs can be especially vulnerable to hazards, including those posed by various types of landscape rock. Knowing what size landscape rock is safe around dogs is essential for avoiding any potential issues that could arise.

<h2>Types of Landscape Rock</h2>

There are a variety of landscape rocks available to choose from, each with its own characteristics. Some of the most common types include pea gravel, crushed stone, river rock, and decomposed granite. Each type of landscape rock can pose different hazards to your pet, so it's important to consider the size and shape of the rock when making your selection.

<h2>Pea Gravel</h2>

Pea gravel is one of the most commonly used types of landscape rock. It is made up of small, round stones that are approximately the size of a pea. Pea gravel is ideal for areas that require drainage, such as walkways or patios, and is often used as a ground cover in flower beds. While pea gravel is generally considered safe for dogs, it can be sharp and can cause discomfort if stepped on.

<h2>Crushed Stone</h2>

Crushed stone is a popular choice for driveways and pathways. It is made up of larger stones that are broken down into smaller pieces, which can range in size from pea gravel to larger stones. The pieces of crushed stone can be sharp, so it is important to select a size that is safe for your pet. Smaller pieces are generally considered to be the safest option.

<h2>River Rock</h2>

River rock is a type of landscape rock that is formed when stones are tumbled in a river or stream. The stones can range in size from pebbles to large boulders, depending on the location of the river. While river rock is a popular choice for landscaping, it can be dangerous for pets. The stones can be sharp and can cause serious injury if stepped on. It is important to select a size that is suitable for your pet.

Decomposed granite is a type of landscape rock that is made up of crushed granite. The pieces can range in size from small pebbles to larger stones. It is a popular choice for pathways and walkways, as it provides a soft, stable surface. While decomposed granite is generally considered safe for pets, it can be sharp and can cause discomfort if stepped on.
