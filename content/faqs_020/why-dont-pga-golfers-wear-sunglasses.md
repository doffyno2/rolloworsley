Why Don't PGA Golfers Wear Sunglasses?

Golf is an outdoor sport that requires players to be exposed to the sun and other elements for extended periods of time. While some golfers do wear sunglasses to protect their eyes from the sun, many professional golfers on the PGA Tour choose not to. This begs the question: why don't PGA golfers wear sunglasses?

There are a few reasons why PGA golfers don’t wear sunglasses. The first and most obvious reason is that sunglasses can be a distraction. Professional golfers are trained to focus on their shots and on the course, and sunglasses can be a distraction from that focus. They can also be a distraction from reading the green. Because golf is a game of precision and accuracy, any little distraction can affect a golfer’s performance.

Another reason why PGA golfers don’t wear sunglasses is that they can interfere with a golfer’s vision. Dark lenses can make it difficult to see the ball and the terrain, which can make it difficult for a golfer to make an accurate shot.

Finally, some golfers simply don’t want to wear sunglasses because they don’t feel comfortable with them. Some golfers prefer not to wear anything on their head while playing, and sunglasses can be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.

So while some PGA golfers do wear sunglasses, many choose not to. They may feel that sunglasses are a distraction, interfere with their vision, or are simply uncomfortable. Ultimately, the decision to wear sunglasses while playing is up to each individual golfer.
