Riding a motorcycle is an exhilarating and liberating experience, but it can be dangerous if you donâ€™t take the right safety precautions. One of the most important items of safety gear a rider can wear is a good pair of goggles. But if you need vision correction, what kind of goggles should you purchase?

<h2>Types of Goggles That Can Provide Vision Correction</h2>

There are several types of goggles that can provide vision correction for riders who need it. The most common types are prescription goggles, clip-on goggles, and inserts. 

<h3>Prescription Goggles</h3>

Prescription goggles are custom-made for each individual rider and provide the best vision correction. The lenses are designed to the rider's exact prescription and are designed to fit the frame of the goggles comfortably and securely. Prescription goggles are generally the most expensive option, but they provide the best vision correction.

<h3>Clip-On Goggles</h3>

Clip-on goggles are a good option for riders who need vision correction but are not ready to invest in prescription goggles. Clip-on goggles are designed to fit over the existing lens of the goggles. They are relatively inexpensive and easy to install. However, they can be bulky and may not provide the best vision correction.

<h3>Inserts</h3>

Inserts are another good option for riders who need vision correction. Inserts are small lenses that fit into the frame of the goggles and provide vision correction. They are relatively inexpensive, but they may not provide the best vision correction.
