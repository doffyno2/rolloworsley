Foodborne diseases are a significant public health concern. They cause millions of illnesses each year and are responsible for thousands of deaths.

<h2>What is a Foodborne Disease?</h2>

A foodborne disease is an illness that is caused by consuming contaminated food. These illnesses can be caused by a variety of agents, including bacteria, viruses, parasites, and toxins. While most foodborne illnesses are mild, some can be severe and even fatal.

The CDC's mission is to protect the health of Americans by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability.

The CDC's Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases (DFWED) is responsible for investigating the spread of foodborne diseases. The DFWED's efforts include monitoring foodborne illnesses, developing food safety standards, and analyzing data related to foodborne illness. The DFWED also works with other government agencies, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to develop food safety regulations.

Other public health agencies, such as state and local health departments, also investigate the spread of foodborne diseases. These agencies typically investigate outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, inspect restaurants and food establishments, and educate the public about food safety.

When a foodborne illness is suspected, public health agencies will investigate the source of the illness. This typically involves collecting and analyzing food samples, interviewing people who have been ill, and inspecting restaurants and food establishments. This information is then used to identify the source of the contamination and implement measures to prevent future outbreaks.

Public health agencies also conduct epidemiological studies to determine the cause and extent of outbreaks. These studies involve collecting and analyzing data from people who have been ill and then comparing it to data from people who have not been ill. This helps public health officials identify common factors that may have led to an outbreak.
