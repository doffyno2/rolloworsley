<p>At one point or another, you may have experienced a sharp pain in your nose when you take a deep breath of cold air. It’s a sensation that is all too familiar and uncomfortable. But why does your nose hurt when you breathe cold air? </p>

<p>The answer is actually quite simple. When you breathe in cold air, your nose and sinuses react by narrowing the blood vessels in your nasal passage. This narrowing of the blood vessels causes a decrease in the amount of oxygen that can reach the nasal membranes. As a result, the nasal membranes become irritated, leading to a feeling of pain or pressure. </p>

<p>In addition, cold air also tends to be dry air, which can irritate the nasal passages even further. The dry air can cause the nose to become inflamed, leading to increased sensitivity and pain. </p>
