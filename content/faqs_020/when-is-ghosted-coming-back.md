<p>Ghosted is an American science fiction comedy television series that originally aired on Fox from October 1, 2017 to January 7, 2018. The series starred Craig Robinson and Adam Scott as two unlikely partners who are hired by a secret government agency to solve a paranormal mystery. The show was created by Tom Gormican and directed by Jonathan Krisel. Despite receiving generally positive reviews, Ghosted was canceled after one season.</p>

<p>Ghosted was one of the first shows of its kind to air on a major network, combining elements of science fiction and comedy with a quirky, offbeat sensibility. It was an ambitious project that quickly caught the attention of viewers, but ultimately failed to draw in enough of an audience to keep it alive. As a result, the show was canceled after just 14 episodes. Now, fans of the show are left wondering when and if Ghosted will ever come back.</p>

<h2>What Happened to Ghosted?</h2>

<p>Ghosted was a victim of the ever-changing landscape of television programming. Despite its clever premise and strong cast, the show failed to draw in a large enough audience to keep it afloat. Fox canceled Ghosted after one season, citing its inability to reach a broad enough audience and its lower-than-expected ratings. The show also faced criticism from some viewers who felt that its comedic elements did not always mesh with its more serious science fiction aspects.</p>

<h2>What Would a Second Season of Ghosted Look Like?</h2>

<p>Ghosted certainly left viewers with more questions than answers when it was canceled. If the show does return, it’s likely that the series would pick up where it left off. We would likely see the further adventures of Leroy and Max as they continue to investigate paranormal activity for a secret government agency. It’s also possible that the show could expand its scope, introducing new characters and further exploring the hidden world of supernatural activity.</p>

<h2>Will Ghosted Ever Come Back?</h2>

<p>It’s hard to say whether Ghosted will ever come back. While the show has a devoted fan base, its cancellation was a major blow. However, with the rise of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon, there is still hope that the show could be brought back in some form. As of right now, there are no definite plans to revive the series, but it’s certainly not out of the question.</p>
