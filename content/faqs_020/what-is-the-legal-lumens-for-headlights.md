<p>Headlights, also known as headlamps, are car lighting fixtures used to illuminate the road ahead when driving in the dark.

As with all car lighting fixtures, headlights must meet certain legal requirements and standards, including the required lumens for headlights. </p>

<p>Lumens are a measure of the total amount of visible light emitted from a light source.

<p>Other types of headlights include LED, HID, and laser headlights. LED headlights are more energy-efficient and last longer than halogen bulbs, while HID headlights offer a brighter light that is more visible in foggy or rainy conditions. Laser headlights are the brightest and most expensive option, but they are only available for certain luxury cars or performance vehicles.</p>
