<p>Waterfowl hunting is one of the most popular and traditional outdoor activities in the United States. Every year, hundreds of thousands of hunters take to the wetlands and marshes in pursuit of ducks and geese. As with any other type of hunting, it is important for waterfowl hunters to use the correct type of ammunition in order to ensure a safe and successful hunt. In order to legally pursue waterfowl, hunters must use non-toxic shotgun pellets.</p>

<p>Non-toxic shotgun pellets are a type of ammunition specifically designed for waterfowl hunting. These pellets are made out of materials that are not poisonous, such as bismuth, steel, tungsten-iron, and tungsten-polymer. Non-toxic shotgun pellets are required by law in the United States in order to protect the environment and reduce the risk of lead poisoning in waterfowl. Lead-based ammunition has been outlawed in the United States since 1991.</p>

<p>When selecting the correct type of shotgun pellets for waterfowl hunting, it is important to consider both the size and the material of the pellets. The size of the pellets will determine how far the shot will travel, while the material of the pellets will determine how effective the shot will be. For example, steel pellets are ideal for long-range shooting, while bismuth pellets are better suited for close-range shooting. Tungsten-iron and tungsten-polymer pellets are both good options for mid-range shooting.</p>

<p>In addition to selecting the right type of shotgun pellets, it is also important to choose the right size. The size of the pellets will determine how much spread the shot will have. For ducks and geese, it is best to use pellets that are between #2 and #4. The smaller the number, the larger the pellet. Larger pellets are better for shooting at longer ranges, while smaller pellets are better for shooting at close range.</p>

<p>When it comes to waterfowl hunting, the type and size of the shotgun pellets are just as important as the gun and ammunition. Non-toxic shotgun pellets must be used in order to comply with the law, and the size and material of the pellets should be chosen based on the type of game being hunted and the range of the shot. By choosing the right type of shotgun pellets, waterfowl hunters can ensure a safe and successful hunt.</p>
