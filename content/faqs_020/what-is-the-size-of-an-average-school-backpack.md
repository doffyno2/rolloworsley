<p>Backpacks are essential pieces of equipment for students, and they come in many sizes and shapes. But what is the size of an average school backpack?</p>

<p>The size of an average school backpack depends on several factors, including the age of the student, the type of activities they are involved in, and the size of their textbooks.
