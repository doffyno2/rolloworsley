Valve is an entertainment software and technology company that has been a pioneer in the gaming industry since 1996. It is well known for its Steam platform, which is the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming. Valve has also developed and published several games, including the critically acclaimed Half-Life and Portal series. Despite their success, Valve has a reputation for being extremely selective when it comes to game development and publishing, and they have been accused of not embracing new ideas or genres. One of the genres that Valve has been accused of not supporting is the 3D platformer, or '3'.

<h2>What is a 3D Platformer?</h2>

3D platformers are a genre of video games that combine platforming mechanics with 3D graphics. These games typically feature a character traversing a 3D environment while overcoming obstacles, collecting items, and solving puzzles. The genre has its roots in classic arcade and console games such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie, though modern 3D platformers have evolved significantly in scope and complexity.

<h2>Valve's History with 3D Platformers</h2>

Valve has been around for more than two decades, yet they have never released a 3D platformer. This is despite the fact that the genre was popularized by one of their own games: the classic 1998 title Half-Life. Half-Life was an early example of a 3D platformer, and it was a commercial and critical success. However, Valve has never followed up on the genre, and they have instead focused on other kinds of games such as first-person shooters and real-time strategy games. 

<h2>Why Does Valve Avoid the Genre?</h2>

The exact reasons why Valve has avoided the 3D platformer genre are not clear, but there are several theories. One possibility is that the company does not believe there is a large enough audience for the genre. 3D platformers require a significant amount of time to develop and are often seen as too “cutesy” for hardcore gamers. Another possibility is that Valve is simply more comfortable with other genres and does not want to venture into unfamiliar territory. 

<h2>Valve's Recent Reception of 3D Platformers</h2>

Despite their apparent aversion to the genre, Valve has recently taken steps to embrace 3D platformers. In 2017, they released the game A Hat in Time, which is a 3D platformer developed by an independent studio. Valve also recently announced that they are working on a 3D platformer of their own, called "Knuckles". This is a clear sign that Valve is becoming more open to the genre and may eventually become a major player in the 3D platformer space.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

Valve has a long history of avoiding 3D platformers, but that may be changing. With their recent support for A Hat in Time and their upcoming game Knuckles, Valve may finally be entering the 3D platformer space. Only time will tell if Valve's new attitude towards 3D platformers will bear fruit, but it is certainly a positive sign for fans of the genre.
