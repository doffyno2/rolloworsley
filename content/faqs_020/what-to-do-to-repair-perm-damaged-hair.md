Permed hair is a popular hairstyle for many people. It is a great way to add texture, volume, and curl to the hair. However, it can also cause damage to the hair, leaving it dry, brittle, and frizzy. If you have permed hair and have noticed it is not looking as healthy as it once was, it is time to take action and repair the damage. In this article, we will discuss what to do to repair perm damaged hair and restore it to its former glory.

<h2>What Causes Perm Damage?</h2>

Perm damage is caused by applying too much heat, using too many chemicals, or using an incorrect type of perming solution. When the hair is over-processed, it can become dry and brittle, making it more difficult to style and manage. In addition, too much heat and/or chemicals can cause the hair to break and split. 

<h2>How to Repair Perm Damaged Hair</h2>

<h3>1. Use a Deep Conditioner</h3>

The first step to repairing perm damaged hair is to use a deep conditioner. Look for a product that contains natural oils such as argan, coconut, or jojoba, as these will help to nourish and replenish the hair. Leave the conditioner in for at least 15 minutes before rinsing. This will help to restore moisture and keep the hair looking healthy.

<h3>2. Avoid Heat Styling</h3>

Heat styling can cause further damage to the hair, so it is best to avoid using any hot tools. If you must use a blow dryer or curling iron, make sure to use the lowest setting possible and use a heat protectant spray.

<h3>3. Use a Protein Treatment</h3>

Protein treatments are great for restoring strength and elasticity to the hair. Look for a product that contains keratin, as this will help to protect the hair and make it more manageable.

Once a week, use a hydrating hair mask to give the hair an extra boost of moisture. Look for a product that contains natural ingredients such as shea butter or avocado oil. Leave the mask in for at least 15 minutes before rinsing.

<h3>7. Avoid Chlorine and Salt Water</h3>

Chlorine and salt water can be very damaging to the hair, so it is best to avoid swimming in them. If you do go swimming, make sure to rinse your hair with fresh water afterwards to help remove any chlorine or salt.
