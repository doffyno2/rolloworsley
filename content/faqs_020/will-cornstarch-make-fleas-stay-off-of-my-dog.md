Fleas are a common problem for dog owners, and getting rid of them can be an expensive and time-consuming process. That’s why some pet owners are looking for an easier and more affordable way to keep fleas off their dog. One of the methods that some pet owners have turned to is cornstarch. But does it really work? In this article, we’ll take a look at the effectiveness of cornstarch as a flea repellent and answer the question: will cornstarch keep fleas off my dog?

<h2>What Is Cornstarch?</h2>

Cornstarch is a type of starch made from corn kernels. It’s often used as a thickening agent, but it can also be used in baking and cooking to add texture and flavor. It’s also a common ingredient in many household products, including laundry detergents and polishes.

<h2>Can Cornstarch Help Keep Fleas Away From My Dog?</h2>

The short answer is yes, cornstarch can help keep fleas away from your dog, but it’s not a guaranteed method. Cornstarch has natural properties that can repel fleas, but it’s not as effective as other methods such as flea collars or topical flea medications.

<h2>How Does Cornstarch Repel Fleas?</h2>

Fleas are attracted to carbon dioxide, which is why they tend to congregate around the neck and head of a dog. Cornstarch has a drying effect on the skin which can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that a dog emits, making it less attractive to fleas. Additionally, cornstarch can help to absorb the oils and sweat on a dog’s skin, making it less hospitable to fleas.

<h2>How Can I Use Cornstarch To Keep Fleas Off My Dog?</h2>

If you’re looking to use cornstarch to help keep fleas off your dog, there are a few methods you can try. 

<h3>Cornstarch Bath</h3>

One of the easiest ways to use cornstarch to keep fleas away from your dog is to give them a cornstarch bath. To do this, you’ll need to mix together one cup of cornstarch and one cup of warm water. Once the mixture is combined, you’ll want to apply it to your dog’s coat and massage it into their fur. Make sure to avoid getting the mixture in their eyes or ears. Allow the mixture to sit for 10-15 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water.

<h3>Cornstarch Sprinkle</h3>

Another method for using cornstarch to repel fleas is to simply sprinkle it on your dog’s fur. This method is especially effective if your dog has thick fur that’s difficult to bathe. To do this, you’ll need to apply a thin layer of cornstarch to your dog’s fur and massage it in. Make sure to avoid getting the cornstarch in their eyes or ears. Allow the cornstarch to sit for 10-15 minutes and then brush it out.

<h3>Cornstarch and Baking Soda</h3>

If you’re looking for an extra boost in repelling fleas, you can mix together cornstarch and baking soda. To do this, you’ll need to mix together two parts cornstarch and one part baking soda. Once the mixture is combined, you’ll want to apply it to your dog’s coat and massage it in. Make sure to avoid getting the mixture in their eyes or ears. Allow the mixture to sit for 10-15 minutes and then rinse it off with warm water.
