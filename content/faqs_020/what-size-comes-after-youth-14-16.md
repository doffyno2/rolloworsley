<p>For parents, shopping for children can be both a fun and daunting task. With so many sizes and styles available, it can be hard to know what size should come after youth 14/16. Fortunately, understanding the sizing system and what comes after is simple and straightforward. </p>

<h2>Understanding Youth Sizes</h2>

<p>Youth sizes, also known as infant sizes, are the sizes that children typically wear before they reach the age of 13. The sizing system for youth clothing is similar to the adult sizing system, but with a few key differences. For example, instead of using a numerical sizing system, youth sizes are generally broken down into age groups. This means that a youth 14/16 is typically for kids aged 14 to 16.</p>

<p>In addition to the age group designation, youth sizes also typically have a corresponding chest and waist measurement. These measurements are usually listed in inches and refer to the circumference of the chest and waist. This measurement system allows for more precise sizing and helps to ensure a better fit for the child.</p>

<h2>What Comes After Youth 14/16?</h2>

<p>Once a child reaches the age of 13, they will typically move on to the adult sizing system. This sizing system is slightly different from the youth sizing system, as it uses numerical sizes instead of age groups. The numerical sizes usually start at size 0 and go up to size 16 or 18. </p>

<p>Since there is no exact equivalent to the youth 14/16 size in the adult sizing system, the best way to determine the correct size is to take measurements of the child’s chest and waist. These measurements can then be compared to a size chart for adults to determine the best size for the child. </p>

<h2>Finding the Right Size</h2>

<p>Finding the right size for a child can be tricky. As a general rule of thumb, it is best to err on the side of caution when selecting a size. If a size is too large, it is usually easier to make the garment smaller than it is to make it larger. </p>

<p>It is also important to remember that sizes can vary from store to store. This is why it is important to try on clothing before making a purchase. This will help ensure that the clothing fits properly and is comfortable for the child to wear. </p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Shopping for children can be overwhelming, especially when it comes to figuring out what size comes after youth 14/16. Fortunately, understanding the sizing system and what comes after is simple and straightforward. Once a child reaches the age of 13, they will typically move on to the adult sizing system.
