Tilikum was a killer whale who lived in captivity at SeaWorld Orlando, Florida for more than 20 years. During his life, he was involved in the deaths of three people, two of whom were trainers who worked with him. His story captured the public's attention, resulting in a widespread discussion on the ethics of keeping killer whales in captivity and the risks that trainers take when working with them. In this article, we will examine who Tilikum killed and the circumstances surrounding each death.

<h2>What Was Tilikum's Early Life Like?</h2>

Tilikum was born in the wild in the waters off Iceland in 1982. He was captured at two years old and taken to Sealand of the Pacific, a marine park in Canada. He was kept there for 11 years until the park closed in 1991. He was then moved to SeaWorld Orlando, and it was here that he became a major attraction. He was the largest orca in captivity and regularly performed in shows alongside his female companion Kasatka.

<h2>The Death of Keltie Byrne</h2>

In 1991, Keltie Byrne, a 20-year-old marine biology student and part-time trainer, entered the pool at Sealand of the Pacific with Tilikum and two other orcas. Eyewitnesses reported that the other orcas began to drag her underwater, and Tilikum ultimately killed her by drowning her.

<h2>The Death of Dawn Brancheau</h2>

In 2010, Tilikum was involved in the death of Dawn Brancheau, a veteran trainer at SeaWorld Orlando. Brancheau was performing a show with Tilikum when the orca suddenly grabbed her and pulled her underwater. She died from drowning and traumatic injury. A subsequent investigation revealed that Tilikum had become increasingly aggressive in recent years, and that the show's protocol may have contributed to the accident.

<h2>The Death of Daniel Dukes</h2>

In July 1999, Tilikum was involved in the death of Daniel Dukes, a 27-year-old man who had snuck into SeaWorld Orlando after-hours. Dukes was found dead the next morning draped over Tilikum's back. An autopsy revealed that Dukes had died from drowning and hypothermia, and that he had been subjected to trauma from Tilikum.

<h2>What Happened to Tilikum After the Deaths?</h2>

After the death of Dawn Brancheau, Tilikum was moved to a smaller pool away from the public, where he spent the remainder of his life. He was not allowed to perform in shows anymore and his contact with humans was limited. In 2016, he passed away due to a bacterial infection.
