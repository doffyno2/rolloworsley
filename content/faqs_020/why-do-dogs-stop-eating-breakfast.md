<p>Dogs, like humans, have an internal clock that regulates their daily habits and activities. This clock is known as their circadian rhythm and it tells them when it’s time to eat, sleep, play, and more. Unfortunately, sometimes this clock gets out of sync, and your pup may suddenly stop eating breakfast. This can be a concerning sign and it's important to understand what could be causing the behavior and how to address it.</p>

<h2>Why Is My Dog Not Eating Breakfast?</h2>
