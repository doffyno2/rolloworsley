<p>Watch Dogs 2 is an action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It is the sequel to 2014's Watch Dogs and was released for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows in November 2016. The game is set within a fictionalized version of the San Francisco Bay Area, an open world with several locations to explore within it. One of the main features of the game is the ability to use various weapons, including silencers.</p>

<p>Silencers, also known as suppressors, are a type of firearm accessory that can be attached to the barrel of a weapon. They are designed to reduce the sound of the weapon being fired, making it much quieter. Silencers are illegal in many countries, including the United States, but they are allowed in some states, such as California, where Watch Dogs 2 takes place.</p>

<p>So, when can you use silencers in Watch Dogs 2? You can use silencers in Watch Dogs 2 once you have unlocked the “Silent Killer” perk. This perk unlocks the ability to equip silencers to a variety of weapons, including handguns, shotguns, and submachine guns. To unlock the perk, you must first complete the “Silent Killer” mission, which is available after completing all of Marcus’s main story missions.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked the perk, you can equip silencers to any weapon that has the “Silenced” icon in its weapon wheel. To equip a silencer, simply select the weapon wheel, then select the “Silenced” icon. This will equip the silencer to the weapon and allow you to use it in the game. The silencer will reduce the sound of the weapon firing, making it much quieter.</p>

<p>Silencers can be a great tool for stealth missions, as they allow you to stay hidden from your enemies. They can also be useful in non-stealth missions, as they allow you to take out enemies without alerting other nearby enemies. However, they do have their drawbacks, as they reduce the damage done by the weapon and increase the recoil, making it more difficult to aim accurately.</p>

<h2>How to Unlock the Silent Killer Perk in Watch Dogs 2</h2>

<p>To unlock the Silent Killer perk in Watch Dogs 2, you must first complete the “Silent Killer” mission. This mission is available after completing all of Marcus’s main story missions. To begin the mission, simply head to the mission marker located in the south-east corner of the map.</p>

<p>Once you have arrived at the mission marker, you will be tasked with infiltrating a compound and taking out a target. You must use stealth to get past the guards and reach your target. Once you have taken out the target, you will be rewarded with the Silent Killer perk, allowing you to equip silencers to your weapons.</p>

<h2>Are Silencers Legal in California?</h2>

<p>Silencers are legal in California, but only for certain types of firearms. According to California state law, silencers are legal on handguns, shotguns, and rifles, provided they are registered with the California Department of Justice. The registration process is relatively simple and can be completed online.</p>

<p>In addition, silencers must be attached to a barrel that is at least 16 inches long. This means that silencers can only be used on weapons with barrels that are at least 16 inches in length. If the barrel is shorter than 16 inches, then the silencer must be removed before the weapon can be fired.</p>

<p>It is important to note that silencers are still illegal under federal law. Even if you are in a state that allows silencers, it is still illegal to possess them without a federal permit. It is also illegal to transport a silencer across state lines without a federal permit.</p>
