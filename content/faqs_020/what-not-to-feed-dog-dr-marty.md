<p>When it comes to caring for our furry friends, it’s important to make sure that we’re providing them with the best possible diet. But, with so many different types of food available, it can be difficult to know what’s safe for our pets and what’s not. In this article, we’ll look at what not to feed your dog according to Dr. Marty, a highly respected veterinarian.</p>

<h2>Table Scraps</h2>

<p>The first thing to avoid when it comes to feeding your pet is table scraps. While it may seem like a good idea to give your pooch leftovers, it’s actually not a great idea. Table scraps can be high in fat, salt, and sugar, which can be unhealthy for your dog. Additionally, your pet may become picky about what they eat if you keep giving them table scraps. If you do decide to give your pet table scraps, make sure they are healthy and appropriate for your dog.</p>

<h2>Certain Fruits and Vegetables</h2>

<p>While fruits and vegetables can be a great part of your pet’s diet, there are some that should be avoided. For example, some fruits such as grapes, raisins, and currants can be toxic for dogs and should never be given to them. Other fruits, such as apples and oranges, should be given in moderation. Additionally, some vegetables, such as onions and garlic, can be toxic for your pet. Be sure to research the fruits and vegetables you are giving your pet before you do so.</p>

<h2>Processed and High-Fat Foods</h2>

<p>Processed and high-fat foods should also be avoided when it comes to your pet’s diet. These types of foods can cause weight gain, which can lead to other health issues. Additionally, processed and high-fat foods can be difficult for your pet to digest, leading to an upset stomach. Stick to foods that are designed for your pet’s digestive system and not processed or high in fat.</p>

<h2>Sugary Treats</h2>

<p>Sugary treats should be avoided when it comes to your pet’s diet. While these treats may seem like a great way to reward your pet, they can actually be quite unhealthy. Sugary treats can cause tooth decay and obesity in your pet. Additionally, they can lead to diabetes and other health issues. Stick to healthy treats that are specifically designed for your pet.</p>

<h2>Raw Meat</h2>

<p>Raw meat should also be avoided when it comes to feeding your pet. While raw meat may seem like a good source of protein, it can actually be dangerous for your pet. Raw meat can contain bacteria that can make your pet sick. Additionally, raw meat can contain parasites that can be passed on to your pet. Stick to cooked, lean meats such as chicken breast or lean ground beef.</p>

<h2>Alcohol</h2>

<p>Finally, alcohol should never be given to your pet. Alcohol can be toxic for your pet and can even lead to death. Additionally, alcohol can cause vomiting, diarrhea, and other health issues. Keep alcohol away from your pet at all times and make sure that your pet is not exposed to any alcoholic beverages.</p>
