<p>Do you ever wake up with a sore collar bone? It can be a strange feeling, and it can be difficult to determine why you are feeling this discomfort. It is important to understand the causes of this type of pain, as well as some common treatments so that you can alleviate your discomfort and get back to living your life. </p>

<h2>What Causes Collar Bone Pain When You Wake Up?</h2>

<p>The collar bone, or “clavicle”, is a long bone located in the shoulder area. It connects the breastbone to the shoulder blade and acts as a support when you move your arms. There are several different causes of collar bone pain when you wake up, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Poor posture</li>
  <li>Muscle strain</li>
  <li>Arthritis</li>
  <li>Osteoporosis</li>
  <li>Injury</li>
</ul>

<p>Poor posture is one of the most common causes of collar bone pain when you wake up. If you sleep in an awkward position, or if you slump forward in your chair for long periods of time, it can cause your collar bone to become strained. Furthermore, if you have a job that requires you to lift heavy objects, you may be putting extra strain on your collar bone without even realizing it. </p>

<p>Muscle strain is another common cause of collar bone pain when you wake up. If you have been over-exercising or doing strenuous activities, it can cause your muscles to become strained and can lead to pain when you wake up. </p>

<p>Arthritis and osteoporosis can also cause collar bone pain when you wake up. Both of these conditions can cause the bones to become weak and brittle, which can lead to pain when you move your arms or stretch in the morning. </p>

<p>Finally, an injury can cause collar bone pain when you wake up. If you have been in an accident or suffered a sports-related injury, it may take some time for the injury to heal. In the meantime, you may experience pain when you wake up in the morning. </p>

<ul>
