High jump is a track and field event in which athletes jump over a bar placed at a certain height. It is an event that dates back to the ancient Olympics, where athletes were required to jump over a stone or a tree trunk placed at a certain height. The current world record for the high jump was set by Yaroslav Rybakov of Russia, who cleared 2.40 meters (7 feet 10¾ inches) in September 2013.

<h2>History of the High Jump</h2>

High jump has been a part of the Olympic Games since the ancient times. In the ancient Olympics, athletes were required to jump over a stone or a tree trunk placed at a certain height. The winner was the person who cleared the highest height.

High jump was also a part of the first modern Olympic Games held in Athens in 1896. The event was won by William Hoyt of the United States who cleared 1.83 meters (6 feet).

<h2>Rules and Regulations of the High Jump</h2>

The high jump event is governed by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The basic rules of the event are as follows:

• The athlete must start from a standing position and must not move forwards or backwards until the bar is cleared.
• The athlete must use an approved technique to clear the bar.
• The athlete must not touch the bar or the ground with any part of his/her body other than the feet. 
• The athlete must not use any artificial aids to gain height or momentum.
• The athlete must clear the bar in one attempt.
• The athlete must not use any form of external assistance to gain an advantage.

The most popular techniques used in high jump are the Straddle, Fosbury Flop and the Western Roll. 

The Straddle technique is the most basic technique and involves the athlete straddling the bar as he/she jumps over it.

The Western Roll technique is the most advanced technique and involves the athlete rolling over the bar as he/she jumps over it.

High jump is an event that requires specialized equipment. The most important piece of equipment is the bar, which is made of metal or fiberglass. The bar is placed on two adjustable stands and can be raised or lowered depending on the athlete’s height.

Other equipment used in high jump includes mats, which are placed on either side of the bar and provide a soft landing surface for the athlete, and pit covers, which are placed over the pits to protect the athlete from injury.
