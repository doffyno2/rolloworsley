When the temperature starts to rise, it's time to start thinking about what to wear in 65 degree weather. It's important to stay comfortable and cool while still looking fashionable. Whether you're attending a summer wedding or just taking a stroll on the beach, having the right outfit is essential. 

<h2>Seasonal Differences</h2>

The type of clothing you wear in 65 degree weather will depend on the season. During the summer months, light and airy fabrics are key. Summer-friendly items include tank tops, shorts, sundresses, and sandals. For cooler days, you can opt for a light jacket or cardigan.
