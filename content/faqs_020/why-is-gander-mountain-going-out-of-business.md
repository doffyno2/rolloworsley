<h2>The History of Gander Mountain</h2>

Gander Mountain is a retail chain of outdoor stores that was founded in 1960 by Robert Sturgis. At that time, the company was known as Gander Mountain Sports Supply, and it was primarily a gun shop. In the early years, the company took advantage of the growing popularity of hunting and fishing to rapidly expand its operations. As the company grew, it began to offer a wide variety of outdoor equipment and apparel, including camping gear, clothing, and boating supplies. By the 1990s, Gander Mountain had become one of the largest outdoor retailers in the United States, with over 100 stores in more than 25 states.

<h2>The Decline of Gander Mountain</h2>

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Gander Mountain began to experience financial difficulties. The company had been unable to keep up with the changing trends in the outdoor retail industry, and it was unable to compete with larger chains like Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops. As a result, Gander Mountain's sales and profits began to decline, and the company began to close stores in an attempt to cut costs.

By 2012, Gander Mountain had declared bankruptcy and was acquired by a private equity firm. The new owners attempted to revitalize the company, but their efforts were unsuccessful. In March 2017, Gander Mountain announced that it was going out of business and closing all of its stores.

<h2>What Caused Gander Mountain To Go Out Of Business?</h2>

There are several factors that contributed to Gander Mountain's decline and eventual bankruptcy. Here are some of the key reasons why the company went out of business:

<h3>1. A Lack of Innovation</h3>

One of the major factors that caused Gander Mountain to go out of business was its lack of innovation. The company had been unable to keep up with the changing trends in the outdoor retail industry, and it was unable to compete with larger chains like Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops. As a result, Gander Mountain's sales and profits began to decline.

<h3>2. Poor Management</h3>

Another factor that contributed to Gander Mountain's decline was its poor management. The company was unable to adapt to the changing trends in the outdoor retail industry, and it failed to keep up with its competitors. As a result, Gander Mountain's sales and profits began to decline.

<h3>3. Competition</h3>

The outdoor retail industry is highly competitive, and Gander Mountain was unable to compete with larger chains like Cabela's and Bass Pro Shops. As a result, Gander Mountain lost market share and was unable to turn a profit.

<h3>4. Debt</h3>

Gander Mountain's financial difficulties were exacerbated by its high levels of debt. The company had taken on large amounts of debt in an attempt to expand, but this strategy backfired and left the company in a precarious financial position.

<h2>What Happened To Gander Mountain After It Went Out Of Business?</h2>

After Gander Mountain announced that it was going out of business, the company began the process of liquidating its assets. All of the company's stores were closed, and the company's inventory and assets were sold off.

In June 2017, Camping World Holdings, Inc. acquired Gander Mountain's assets and trademarks. The company has since re-opened several Gander Mountain stores and has plans to open more in the future.
