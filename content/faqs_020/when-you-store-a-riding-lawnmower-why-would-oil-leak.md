When the weather turns cold and snow begins to blanket the ground, homeowners with riding lawnmowers will need to store them away until the spring. It is important to store the lawnmower properly to ensure that it is in good condition when it is ready to be used again. In addition, it is important to know why oil may leak during the storage process and how to prevent it.

<h2>Why Store a Riding Lawnmower?</h2>

Before the winter weather arrives, it is important to store away riding lawnmowers until the spring. Storing the lawnmower helps protect it from harsh weather and can help extend the life of the machine. Most manufacturers recommend storing the lawnmower in a dry, secure place, such as a garage or shed. If a garage or shed is not available, the lawnmower can be stored in any sheltered area that is out of the elements.

<h2>Preparing the Lawnmower for Storage</h2>

Before storing a riding lawnmower, it is important to prepare the machine. This includes draining the gas tank, replacing the oil, and cleaning the mower. It is important to drain the gas tank because the fuel in the tank can separate and become gummy over time. This can cause the fuel lines and carburetor to become clogged. Similarly, the oil should be replaced before storage because old oil can become acidic and can damage the engine. Finally, the mower should be thoroughly cleaned to prevent rust and corrosion.

<h2>Why Would Oil Leak During Storage?</h2>

If a riding lawnmower is not properly prepared for storage, it can develop leaks in the oil system. This is because the seals and gaskets in the oil system can dry out and crack. This can cause oil to leak from the engine, which can damage the machine and surrounding area.

<h2>How to Prevent Oil Leaks During Storage</h2>

To prevent oil leaks during storage, it is important to properly prepare the riding lawnmower. This includes draining the gas tank, replacing the oil, and cleaning the mower. Additionally, it is important to use a good quality oil sealant before storage. This can help keep the seals and gaskets in the oil system soft and supple, which can reduce the chances of leaks.

<h2>What Else Should be Done Before Storing a Riding Lawnmower?</h2>

In addition to preparing the riding lawnmower for storage, it is important to check the air filter and spark plugs. The air filter should be replaced and the spark plugs should be cleaned and inspected. If the spark plugs are worn or damaged, they should be replaced. Finally, the blades should be sharpened to ensure that they are ready for use in the spring.

<h2>What Should be Done After Storing a Riding Lawnmower?</h2>

When the riding lawnmower is ready to be used again, it is important to check the oil level and the air filter. The oil should be topped off and the air filter should be replaced. Additionally, the spark plugs should be cleaned and inspected and the blades should be sharpened.
