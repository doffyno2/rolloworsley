Tiger sharks are among the most well-known and feared of all sharks. These apex predators are well-known for their predatory behavior and large size. While they are feared, they are also an important part of the ocean ecosystem. In this article, we will explore the life cycle of the tiger shark, from birth to adulthood.

<h2>Tiger Shark Eggs</h2>

The tiger shark is a viviparous species, meaning that they give birth to live young. Before this happens, though, the female tiger shark lays eggs. Tiger shark eggs are laid in a rigid egg case, also known as a mermaid's purse. Each egg case contains several eggs, which are surrounded by a hard, leathery casing. This casing protects them from predators and the elements.

<h2>Tiger Shark Larvae</h2>

Once the eggs have been laid, the larvae will hatch within the egg case. The larvae are about 3 inches long and are characterized by their small size and their yolk sac, which is attached to the body and provides nutrition for the young shark. The larvae are free-swimming and will typically live in shallow waters until they are large enough to venture into deeper waters. 

<h2>Tiger Shark Juveniles</h2>

Once the larvae have matured, they become juveniles. At this stage, they are still relatively small, typically reaching lengths of around 4 to 5 feet. As they grow larger, they become more independent and will venture further away from the shore. Juvenile tiger sharks will typically feed on small fish, crabs, shrimp, and other small marine creatures.

<h2>Tiger Shark Adulthood</h2>

At around 8 to 10 years of age, the tiger shark will reach adulthood. At this stage, the shark will be much larger, usually reaching lengths of around 10 to 12 feet. Adult tiger sharks are powerful predators and will feed on a variety of large marine creatures, such as seals, sea turtles, and dolphins. 

<h2>Reproduction</h2>

Adult tiger sharks will reproduce by mating. The female tiger shark will typically lay her eggs in shallow waters near the shore, where the larvae will have an easier time finding food. After mating, the female will usually remain in the area for several weeks before moving on.

<h2>Longevity</h2>

Tiger sharks are long-lived creatures and can live for up to 20 years in the wild. They are also relatively slow-growing, taking up to 10 years to reach adulthood.
