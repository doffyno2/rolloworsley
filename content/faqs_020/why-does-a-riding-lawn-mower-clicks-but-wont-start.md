<p>Having a lawn mower that won't start can be a frustrating experience. Whether you are a homeowner looking to maintain your own lawn or a professional landscaper trying to keep up with a job, a riding lawn mower that won't start can mean lost time, money, and energy. If your riding lawn mower is clicking, but won't start, it's important to figure out the cause so you can get back to mowing in no time.</p>

<h2>What Causes a Riding Lawn Mower to Click but Not Start?</h2>

<p>A riding lawn mower that clicks but won't start is likely due to a faulty starter motor or solenoid. The starter motor is responsible for supplying power to the engine in order to start it. When it fails, the engine won't start, and a clicking sound will occur when the key is turned. The solenoid is also a possible cause for the clicking sound. The solenoid is an electrical switch that is responsible for connecting the battery to the starter motor. If the solenoid fails, it won't be able to make the connection, and the lawn mower won't start.</p>

<h2>How to Diagnose a Riding Lawn Mower That Clicks but Won't Start</h2>

<p>If your riding lawn mower is clicking but won't start, it's important to diagnose the problem in order to make the necessary repairs. The first step is to check the battery and ensure it has enough charge. If the battery is dead or low, it won't be able to power the starter motor, and the lawn mower won't start. You can also check the starter motor and solenoid for any visible signs of damage or wear. If they appear to be in good condition, you can test them with a multimeter to see if they are functioning properly.</p>

<h2>How to Fix a Riding Lawn Mower That Clicks but Won't Start</h2>

<p>If your riding lawn mower is clicking but won't start, there are a few potential fixes that you can try. The first step is to check the battery and make sure it has enough charge. If the battery is low or dead, you'll need to recharge or replace it. You can also check the starter motor and solenoid for any visible signs of damage or wear. If they appear to be in good condition, you can test them with a multimeter to see if they are functioning properly.</p>

<p>If the starter motor and solenoid are functioning properly, you can try replacing the spark plug.
