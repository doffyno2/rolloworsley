<p>If you’ve recently changed your brake pads and noticed a squeaking sound coming from them, you’re not alone. In fact, this is a common issue with brakes and it’s often caused by a variety of factors. In this article, we’ll explore why brakes squeak after they’ve been changed and what you can do to stop the squeaking.</p>

<h2>What Causes Squeaking Brakes?</h2>

<p>When you change your brakes, if the friction material is not properly seated, it can cause a squeaking sound. This is because, as the brakes are used, the friction material rubs against the brake rotor, creating a squeaking sound. The squeaking sound is caused by vibrations as the friction material rubs against the rotor.</p>

<p>Another cause of squeaking brakes is glazing. Glazing occurs when the brake pad material wears down to a very thin layer, causing the pad to become smooth and shiny. This causes it to lose its grip and makes it more likely to vibrate against the rotor, causing the squeaking sound.</p>

<p>Finally, dirt and debris can also cause squeaking brakes. If dirt, dust, or other debris gets lodged between the brake pad and rotor, it can cause a squeaking sound when the brakes are used.</p>

<h2>How To Stop Squeaking Brakes</h2>

<p>If your brakes are squeaking, there are several steps you can take to stop the squeaking. The first is to check the brakes for any signs of glazing. If the pads appear to be glazed, they should be replaced. This will help ensure that the brakes are gripping the rotor properly and not causing any vibrations.</p>

<p>If the brakes appear to be in good condition, you can try cleaning the brake rotors and pads. This can help remove any dirt or debris that may have been causing the squeaking sound. You can use a brake cleaner or a mild soap and water solution to clean the rotors and pads.</p>

<p>If the squeaking persists, you may need to adjust the brake pads. This can be done by removing the brake pads and adjusting the contact point between the pads and the rotors. This can help ensure that the pads are gripping the rotors properly and that the squeaking sound is eliminated.</p>

<h2>Can Squeaking Brakes Damage The Rotors?</h2>

<p>Squeaking brakes can cause damage to the rotors over time. When the squeaking occurs, it causes the friction material on the brake pads to rub against the rotor. This can cause wear and tear on the rotor, which can lead to the need for replacement rotors.</p>

<p>In addition to causing wear and tear on the rotor, squeaking brakes can also cause damage to the brake pads. The constant vibration and friction can cause the pads to wear down faster than normal, leading to the need for replacement pads as well.</p>

<h2>Are Squeaking Brakes Dangerous?</h2>

<p>Squeaking brakes can be dangerous if the brakes are not functioning properly. If the brakes are not gripping the rotor correctly, they may not stop the vehicle as quickly or efficiently as they should. This can lead to an increased risk of an accident or other serious injury.</p>

<p>It is important to have your brakes inspected regularly by a professional mechanic to ensure that they are functioning properly. If your brakes are squeaking, it is important to have them inspected and repaired as soon as possible.</p>
