The fog line, also known as the white line or the center line, is a divider between lanes of traffic on a highway or other roadway. It is a painted line on the pavement that is made visible by a reflective material, typically glass beads or mica. The fog line is an important safety feature that helps drivers maintain their lane position and avoid sideswiping or head-on collisions.

<h2>History of the Fog Line</h2>

The fog line was first created in the 1930s as a way to improve highway safety. The idea was to provide a visible marker for drivers to follow, even in inclement weather when visibility was poor. The original fog lines were painted with lead-based paint, which was later replaced with reflective materials such as glass beads or mica. The reflective materials made the fog line more visible at night, reducing the chance of an accident due to poor visibility.

<h2>How the Fog Line is Used</h2>

The fog line is used as a marker to divide lanes of traffic and as a guide for drivers. It helps drivers to maintain proper lane position and stay on the correct side of the road. It is also used to warn drivers of upcoming curves or turns in the road.

<h2>Types of Fog Lines</h2>

There are three types of fog lines that can be used on roadways. The most common type is the solid white line, which is used to mark the boundaries between lanes of traffic. The other two types are the broken white line, which is used to indicate that lanes can be crossed, and the double yellow line, which is used to indicate that lane-changing is not permitted.

<h2>Importance of the Fog Line</h2>

The fog line is an important safety feature on highways and other roadways. It helps drivers maintain lane position and stay on the correct side of the road, which reduces the chance of an accident. The visibility of the fog line also helps drivers to stay alert and focused on the road.
