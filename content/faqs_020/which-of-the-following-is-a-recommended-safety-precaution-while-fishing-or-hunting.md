Fishing and hunting are two popular outdoor activities that come with a variety of safety precautions. Whether you’re an experienced angler or a novice hunter, it’s important to know the best safety practices to ensure you have a safe and enjoyable outdoor experience. Here’s a closer look at some of the most recommended safety precautions to keep in mind while fishing or hunting.

When hunting, you should wear blaze orange clothing and a blaze orange cap or hat. This will help to make sure you’re visible to other hunters in the area and will also help to prevent you from becoming a target.
