<p>When it comes to extreme temperatures, the Earth can get pretty hot. Some of the hottest places on the planet reach temperatures so high they can be dangerous to humans. But what is the hottest thing on Earth? The answer depends on what you consider to be the hottest thing.</p>

<p>At the surface level, the hottest thing on Earth is lava. Lava is molten rock that comes from volcanoes. It can reach up to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit or 1,204 degrees Celsius. This makes it the hottest naturally-occurring substance on our planet.</p>

<h2>What is Lava?</h2>

<p>Lava is molten rock that is expelled from volcanoes. It is created when molten rock from the Earth’s mantle is forced to the surface during an eruption. The molten rock is made of multiple types of minerals, including basalt and granite. As it erupts and flows, it cools and hardens, forming the rocky terrain we often associate with volcanoes.</p>

<p>The temperature of lava depends on its composition. Basaltic lava is typically the hottest, reaching temperatures up to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit or 1,204 degrees Celsius. Granitic lava is cooler, reaching temperatures up to 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit or 982 degrees Celsius.</p>

<h2>What Are the Hottest Man-Made Things?</h2>

<p>While lava is the hottest thing on Earth, scientists have created things that are even hotter. The hottest man-made object is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator located in Switzerland. The LHC has the ability to reach temperatures up to 5.5 trillion degrees Fahrenheit or 3 trillion degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>The LHC works by speeding up particles to near the speed of light and smashing them together. This creates temperatures hotter than those found at the center of the sun. While this is an impressive feat, the particle collisions only last for a fraction of a second.</p>

<h2>What Are the Hottest Non-Man-Made Things?</h2>

<p>The hottest non-man-made things on Earth are the stars in the universe. Stars are giant balls of gas that are held together by their own gravity. At the core of a star, the temperature can reach up to 27 million degrees Fahrenheit or 15 million degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>The closest star to us is the sun. The sun’s core reaches temperatures up to 27 million degrees Fahrenheit or 15 million degrees Celsius. That’s around 300,000 times hotter than lava!</p>

<h2>What is the Hottest Thing in Space?</h2>

<p>The hottest thing in space is a supernova, a massive explosion that occurs when a star dies. During a supernova, temperatures can reach up to 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit or 5.5 billion degrees Celsius. This is around 350 million times hotter than lava.</p>

<p>Supernovas occur when a star runs out of fuel and collapses. The resulting explosion is so powerful that it can outshine an entire galaxy. Supernovas can last for weeks or months before fading away.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>So, what is the hottest thing on Earth? The answer depends on what you consider to be the hottest thing. Lava is the hottest naturally-occurring substance on our planet, reaching temperatures up to 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit or 1,204 degrees Celsius. But the Large Hadron Collider is the hottest man-made object, reaching temperatures up to 5.5 trillion degrees Fahrenheit or 3 trillion degrees Celsius. Stars are the hottest non-man-made objects, with the sun’s core reaching temperatures up to 27 million degrees Fahrenheit or 15 million degrees Celsius. But the hottest thing in space is a supernova, with temperatures reaching up to 10 billion degrees Fahrenheit or 5.5 billion degrees Celsius.</p>
