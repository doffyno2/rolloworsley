<p>The answer depends on the type of archery Lars is doing. He uses traditional bows when shooting in the traditional style, which is the style Lars is most known for. But he also uses recurve bows and compound bows when doing more modern styles of archery. Here's a look at the different types of bows Lars Andersen uses.</p>

<h2>Traditional Bows</h2>

<p>When Lars Andersen is shooting in the traditional style, he uses traditional bows. These bows are made from a single piece of wood, usually yew or osage orange.

<h2>Recurve Bows</h2>

<h2>Compound Bows</h2>

<p>Compound bows are the most modern type of bow, and they are the type Lars Andersen is most often seen using for modern archery. Compound bows are designed with a system of pulleys and cables, which give the bow more power.

He prefers the compound bow for its power and accuracy, and he is often seen shooting with a compound bow that has a draw weight of around 40-50 pounds.
