Captions also make videos more understandable for viewers who are learning a foreign language.</p>

<p>Once the captions are added to a video, viewers can enable or disable the captions by clicking on the “CC” button located at the bottom of the video. If the captions are enabled, the text will appear at the bottom of the video. The text can be in any language, depending on the language of the video. Some videos even have multiple captions in multiple languages.</p>

<h2>Where Can I Find CC?</h2>
