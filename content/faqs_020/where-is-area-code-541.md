<p>Area code 541 is an Oregon area code that serves the western portion of the state. It was created in 1995 and covers the majority of the state's land area, including the major cities of Eugene, Medford, Bend, and Corvallis.</p>

<p>Area code 541 is a geographic area code, meaning that it covers an entire region rather than a single city or county. The area code is used for landline and cellular phone numbers, as well as fax numbers. It is also used for text messaging, which is increasingly popular with younger generations.</p>

<p>The area code is used in rural areas and small towns in Oregon, as well as in larger cities. It covers the western portion of the state, including the larger cities of Eugene, Medford, Bend, and Corvallis. It is also used in smaller cities such as Ashland, Roseburg, Klamath Falls, and Grants Pass.</p>

<p>Area code 541 is an overlay area code, meaning that it overlays an existing area code. The existing area code, 503, covers the eastern portion of the state. When dialing a number in the 503 area code from within the 541 area code, you must dial the area code and the seven-digit phone number. When dialing from outside the 503 or 541 area codes, you must dial 1 plus the area code, followed by the seven-digit phone number.</p>

<h2>History of Area Code 541</h2>

<p>Area code 541 was created in 1995 as an overlay code to serve the western portion of Oregon, which was previously served by the 503 area code. At the time, the 503 area code was quickly running out of numbers due to the increasing need for phone numbers in the state. The 541 area code was created to alleviate the issue and provide additional phone numbers for the growing population.</p>

<p>In 2010, area code 458 was created as an overlay to both the 503 and 541 area codes. This new area code provides additional phone numbers to the region and helps to ensure that the 503 and 541 area codes are able to meet the needs of the growing population.</p>
