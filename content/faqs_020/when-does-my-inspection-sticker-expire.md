<p>In most states, vehicle inspection stickers are a required part of owning and operating a vehicle. They let people know that the vehicle has been inspected and is up to code. But how long does a vehicle’s inspection sticker last?</p>

<p>Inspection stickers are typically issued for a specified period of time. This time period can vary from state to state, but it is usually approximately one year. During this period of time, the vehicle must pass an inspection in order to maintain its sticker. Depending on the state, there may be additional requirements for the vehicle to pass inspection. For example, some states may require the vehicle to have certain safety features in place, such as working headlights and taillights.</p>

<p>In most states, it is the responsibility of the vehicle owner to have their vehicle inspected on a regular basis. It is important to note that the inspection sticker is not valid until the vehicle has actually passed inspection. If a vehicle fails its inspection, the owner must make the necessary repairs before they can receive a valid sticker.</p>

<p>If a vehicle passes inspection, the owner will receive an inspection sticker that is valid until the expiration date noted on the sticker. At this point, the vehicle must be inspected again in order to receive a new sticker. It is important to note that the inspection sticker does not guarantee that the vehicle is in perfect condition. It simply means that the vehicle meets the standards set by the state in which it is registered. If a vehicle fails to meet these standards, it may be considered unsafe to operate and could be subject to fines or other penalties.</p>

<p>In some states, a vehicle must be inspected every two years instead of every year. This is because some states do not want to burden their citizens with the cost of having their vehicles inspected every year. In these states, the inspection sticker is valid for two years instead of just one.</p> 

<p>It is important to stay up to date on when your vehicle’s inspection sticker expires. If the sticker expires, the vehicle must be inspected again in order to receive a new sticker. It is also important to keep in mind that some states may require additional inspections, such as emissions testing. It is important to stay up to date with all of the regulations in your state in order to ensure that your vehicle is in compliance.</p>

<h2>What Happens If I Don’t Get My Vehicle Inspected?</h2>

In some states, it can also result in the vehicle being impounded until the owner has the vehicle inspected and receives a valid sticker. It is important to be aware of the laws in your state and to make sure that your vehicle is inspected on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>What Should I Do If My Vehicle Fails Inspection?</h2>

<p>If a vehicle fails inspection, the owner must make the necessary repairs in order to have the vehicle pass inspection. Depending on the type of repair needed, it may be necessary to take the vehicle to a certified mechanic. In some cases, the repairs can be made by the owner. It is important to keep in mind that the repairs must be made before the vehicle can receive a valid inspection sticker.</p>

<h2>Are There Exemptions To The Inspection Requirements?</h2>
