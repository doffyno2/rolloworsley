<p>Jimmy Buffett is one of the most iconic singers, songwriters, and performers of our time. His music has been widely influential, inspiring many different generations of musicians and fans alike. But where was Jimmy Buffett born and raised?</p>

<p>Jimmy Buffett was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi on December 25, 1946. He is the son of Mary Lorraine and James Delaney Buffett, Jr. Jimmy was the second of three children, with an older sister and a younger brother.

<p>Jimmy Buffett’s musical career kicked off when he moved to Nashville. He signed with Barnaby Records and released his first album, Down To Earth, in 1970. From there, he slowly gained a cult following and released a number of successful albums. His most popular album to date is 1977’s Changes In Latitudes, Changes In Attitudes, which includes his signature song “Margaritaville.”</p>

<p>Though he is most closely associated with the beaches of the Caribbean, Buffett’s roots are firmly planted in the south.

<p>It was around this time that Buffett began to develop the “Parrothead” lifestyle that his fans have come to love.
