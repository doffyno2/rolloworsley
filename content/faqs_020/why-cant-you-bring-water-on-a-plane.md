<p>When it comes to airline travel, there are a few surprising items that you are not allowed to bring on board. One of the most common items that people forget about is water. Although water is an essential item for any traveler, it is not allowed on planes for a variety of reasons. In this article, we’ll take a look at why you can’t bring water on a plane, and what you can do to stay hydrated while flying.</p>

<h2>Why Is Water Not Allowed on Planes?</h2>

<p>The main reason why water is not allowed on planes is due to security concerns. It is possible for certain containers of water to contain hazardous materials or even explosives. In order to prevent any potential security risks, airports and airlines have implemented a strict policy forbidding passengers from bringing large containers of water on board.</p>

<p>Another reason why water is not allowed on planes is because it is considered a potential health hazard. In an enclosed space such as an airplane cabin, germs from one person’s water bottle can easily spread to other passengers. This is especially true when the plane is in flight, as the air pressure can cause germs to spread more quickly. For this reason, airlines prefer that passengers bring sealed bottled water on their flights.</p>

<h2>What Are the Alternatives for Staying Hydrated?</h2>

<p>If you’re planning to travel by air, it’s important to plan ahead and bring enough sealed bottled water with you. Most airports and airlines allow passengers to bring up to one liter of water per passenger. It is important to note that the water must be sealed and that it should not be opened until after you’ve passed through security.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to bring your own water, you can always purchase bottled water at the airport. Most airports have a variety of bottled water options, including sparkling, still, and flavored waters. You can also purchase bottled water after you’ve gone through security, at vending machines or snack bars. Be aware that some airports may not sell bottled water, so it’s best to plan ahead and bring your own.</p>

<h2>Can You Bring Empty Water Bottles on a Plane?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes, you can bring empty water bottles on a plane. However, it is important to note that the bottles must be empty when you go through security. You will also need to make sure that the bottles are tightly sealed and do not contain any liquids. Once you’ve passed through security, you can fill up your water bottle at a drinking fountain or purchase bottled water at a vending machine or snack bar.</p>

<h2>Tips for Staying Hydrated While Flying</h2>

<p>To stay hydrated while flying, make sure to bring enough sealed bottled water with you to last the entire flight. If you plan on purchasing water at the airport or on the plane, make sure to check the prices beforehand so you can budget accordingly. Additionally, try to drink a glass of water before, during, and after your flight to keep your body hydrated. Lastly, be sure to pack a few snacks in your carry-on bag to keep your energy levels up during your flight.</p>
