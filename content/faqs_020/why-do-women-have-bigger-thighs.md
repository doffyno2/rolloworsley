<p>The simple answer to the question of why women have bigger thighs than men is hormones. Women have more estrogen, which is the primary hormone responsible for the development and maintenance of female characteristics. This hormone causes the body to store more fat in the gluteal and thigh areas, resulting in larger thighs. </p>

<p>The difference in thigh size between men and women is also due to the fact that women generally have wider hips than men. The wider hip structure means that the thigh muscles have to work harder to support the larger frame. This, combined with increased fat storage in the thigh area, results in larger legs on women. </p>

<p>In addition to hormones and hip structure, other factors can contribute to why women have bigger thighs than men. Women tend to have less muscle mass than men and therefore less muscle tone in their legs. This can result in larger thigh measurements compared to men. </p>
