<p>It is a question that has been debated for more than a century now â€“ who was the oldest person riding the Titanic? The answer to this question is not as straightforward as it may seem. This is because the exact age of many of the passengers on the ill-fated ocean liner is not known. However, there are several people who have been identified as being among the oldest passengers on the Titanic, and their stories are as interesting as they are tragic.</p>

<p>The oldest passenger on the Titanic is believed to be 81-year-old Elizabeth Gladys "Millvina" Dean. She was born in London on February 2, 1912, just months before the Titanic set sail. She was the youngest of three children of Bertram Frank Dean, a London wine merchant, and his wife, Eva. At the time of the Titanic's voyage, the family was living in Southampton, England.</p>

<p>Elizabeth, her mother, and her two brothers were all passengers on the Titanic. When the Titanic struck the iceberg, the family was separated. Elizabeth and her brothers were placed in a lifeboat and survived. Her mother, however, was not so fortunate and died in the sinking.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was the last surviving Titanic passenger. She died in 2009 at the age of 97. She had spent the last 97 years of her life living in Southampton and was a highly respected member of her community. She was also a keen Titanic enthusiast and wrote several books about her experience.</p>

<p>Another elderly passenger on the Titanic was 77-year-old American businessman Benjamin Guggenheim. He was born in Philadelphia in 1845 and was a highly successful businessman. He had made his fortune in the mining industry and was a member of the wealthy and influential Guggenheim family. Guggenheim was traveling to New York on the Titanic with his valet and two mistress, both of whom survived the sinking.</p>

<p>Guggenheim was last seen alive on the deck of the Titanic, wearing a dinner jacket and smoking a cigarette, as the ship went down. His body was never recovered, but his death was reported in the New York Times on April 20, 1912. He is remembered as a brave and noble gentleman, and his story has been retold many times since.</p>

<p>The third oldest passenger on the Titanic was 75-year-old Englishman and retired sea captain Edward John Smith. Smith had been a sailor since the age of 14 and was one of the most experienced captains of his time. He was the captain of the Titanic when it set sail on its ill-fated voyage and was on the bridge when the ship struck the iceberg.</p>

<p>Smith stayed on the bridge until the end, and his body was never recovered. His name is immortalized in the song "Eternal Father, Strong to Save," which was written by William Whiting in 1861 in honor of Smith's bravery. Smith is also remembered as a hero who gave his own life to save others.</p>

<p>These are just a few of the elderly passengers who were on board the Titanic, but there are many more stories to be told. The Titanic may have been doomed from the start, but the courage and heroism of its passengers will never be forgotten.</p>
