# Why is My Dog's Neck Hot?

It's natural for pet owners to be concerned when they notice their dog's neck is hot, especially when the rest of their body seems to be at a normal temperature. While the cause of the heat can usually be traced to something relatively minor, it's important to know why it's happening and how to address it.

## What Causes a Dog's Neck to be Hot?

There are several potential causes of a hot neck in dogs, some of which are relatively harmless and others that may require medical attention. Common causes of a hot neck in dogs include:

### Heatstroke 

Heatstroke occurs when a dog is exposed to excessive or extreme heat, or when they are unable to cool off properly. It's important to recognize the signs of heatstroke in dogs, which can include panting, drooling, red gums, excessive thirst, lethargy, and a hot neck. If you suspect your pet is suffering from heatstroke, contact your veterinarian immediately.

### Skin Infections

Bacterial and fungal skin infections can also cause a dog's neck to become hot. These infections usually require medical attention and can be accompanied by other symptoms such as redness, itching, and scabs.

### Allergies

Allergic reactions can also cause a dog's neck to become hot. Allergies can be caused by environmental factors such as pollen, dust mites, or mold, as well as certain foods. If your pet is exhibiting other signs of an allergic reaction such as hives, vomiting, or diarrhea, contact your veterinarian.

### Parasites 

Parasites such as fleas and ticks can cause a hot neck in dogs as they move around and irritate the skin. If you see any parasites on your pet or if you notice any other signs of an infestation such as scratching or biting at the skin, contact your veterinarian.

### Stress 

Stress can also cause a dog's neck to become hot. Dogs can become stressed for a variety of reasons, including loud noises, changes in the environment, or being left alone for long periods of time. If you think your pet is feeling stressed, try to create a calm and relaxed environment for them and contact your veterinarian if the problem persists.

## How to Check for a Hot Neck

In order to check for a hot neck in your pet, it's important to first make sure that the temperature of the environment is not too hot. If the room is uncomfortably warm, move your pet to a cooler area. Once the environment is cool, you can feel your pet's neck with the back of your hand. If the neck feels hot to the touch, it's likely that there is an underlying cause that needs to be addressed.

## What to Do if Your Dog's Neck is Hot 

If your pet's neck is hot, the first step is to contact your veterinarian to discuss potential causes and treatments. Depending on the cause of the heat, your veterinarian may recommend medications or other treatments. Additionally, it's important to make sure your pet is able to cool down and stay hydrated, especially during hot weather.
