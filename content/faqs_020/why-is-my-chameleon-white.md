Chameleons are known for their amazing ability to change color, but some chameleons are born with an entirely white coloration. Though it may seem strange, this coloration is actually quite common in certain species of chameleons. Let’s take a look at why some chameleons are born white.

<h2>What Causes White Chameleons?</h2>

White chameleons come from a recessive gene found in some species of the reptile. This gene causes the chameleon to be born with no color, resulting in a white chameleon. This gene is found in some species of chameleons from the Calumma, Furcifer, Brookesia, and Rieppeleon genera. 

The recessive gene responsible for white chameleons has been found in some species of the Calumma genus, including the Calumma parsonii, Calumma globifer, Calumma hafahafa, and Calumma crypticum. Some species of the Furcifer genus, such as the Furcifer oustaleti, Furcifer labordi, and Furcifer pardalis, also carry the gene. Additionally, some species of the Brookesia and Rieppeleon genera, such as the Brookesia peyrierasi and Rieppeleon brevicaudatus, have been known to have the gene. 

<h2>Do White Chameleons Change Color?</h2>

White chameleons may have a recessive gene that causes them to be born white, but that doesn’t mean that they can’t change color. As these chameleons age, they can still change color, but the colors that they can change to will be limited.

White chameleons will typically be able to change to colors such as yellow, brown, and green. However, they won’t be able to change to colors like blue, red, and purple. This is because the white chameleon’s skin lacks the cells called chromatophores that allow other chameleons to change to those colors. 

<h2>What Are the Benefits of Having a White Chameleon?</h2>

White chameleons may not be able to change color as much as other chameleons, but they do have some advantages. White chameleons are better able to reflect the sun’s heat than colored chameleons, making them better adapted to hot climates. Additionally, white chameleons make it easier for predators to spot them, so they can use their white coloration as a form of camouflage.

<h2>How to Care for a White Chameleon</h2>

Caring for a white chameleon is much the same as caring for a colored chameleon. White chameleons require a large enclosure with plenty of vegetation and branches for climbing. The enclosure should also include a heat lamp, a full-spectrum light, and a water dish.

White chameleons should also be fed a variety of live insects such as crickets, mealworms, and waxworms. It is also important to provide your white chameleon with calcium and vitamin supplements to ensure that they are getting the proper nutrition.
