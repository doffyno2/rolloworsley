<p>Laughter is a natural reaction to something funny or enjoyable, but for some people, laughter can be a source of pain. A condition known as "pleurisy" is one of the most common explanations for why it hurts when we laugh. It occurs when the pleura, a thin membrane surrounding the lungs, is inflamed. Symptoms of pleurisy include sharp chest pain, difficulty breathing, and a feeling of tightness in the chest. Pain usually worsens with deep breaths or when laughing. </p>

<p>Pleurisy is not the only cause of laughter-induced pain. Other possible causes include intercostal muscle strain, chest wall pain, costochondritis, and a rib fracture. Intercostal muscle strain is an injury to the muscles between the ribs, which can cause pain when breathing or laughing. Chest wall pain is a vague term used to describe pain in the chest wall, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as shingles, a chest infection, or a rib fracture. Costochondritis is an inflammation of the cartilage connecting the ribs to the breastbone and is often accompanied by pain when laughing. Finally, a rib fracture may cause pain when laughing due to the movement of the fractured bone.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for people to experience pain when laughing, and it can be alarming. However, in most cases it is a minor injury or inflammation and can be treated with rest, ice, and anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen. However, if the pain persists or becomes severe, it is important to see a doctor for a proper diagnosis and treatment. </p>

<h2>How Is Pleurisy Treated?</h2>
