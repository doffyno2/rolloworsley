<p>GoPro cameras are a great way to capture stunning footage, and the playback feature is essential to seeing the results of your hard work. Unfortunately, some users may experience their GoPro playing back footage in slow motion. This can be frustrating, especially if you’re not sure why it’s happening. </p>

<p>In this article, we’ll discuss why your GoPro might be playing back in slow motion and what you can do to fix it. We’ll discuss the different settings that can affect playback speed, as well as how to troubleshoot the issue if you’re still having problems. Read on to find out more.</p>

<h2>Why Does My GoPro Playback in Slow Motion?</h2>

<p>Your GoPro’s playback speed may be affected by a few different settings. The most common issue is that the camera’s settings have been set to record in slow motion. If this is the case, the footage will playback in slow motion, even if it was recorded at regular speed. </p>

<p>The other possibility is that the frame rate of the footage is too slow. If the frame rate is too slow, the footage will playback in slow motion. This is because there are fewer frames per second, so the playback appears slower. </p>

<p>Finally, the playback speed may be affected by the type of media you’re using to view the footage. For example, if you’re viewing the footage on an older device, it may not be able to keep up with the frame rate of the footage, resulting in a slower playback. </p>

<h2>How to Fix a Slow Motion Playback Problem</h2>

<p>The first step to fixing a slow motion playback problem is to check the camera’s settings. Make sure that the camera is not set to record in slow motion. If it is, switch it back to regular speed. </p>

<p>Next, check the frame rate of the footage. If it’s too slow, you can try increasing the frame rate. This will make the footage play back faster. However, if you do this, make sure that your device can handle the increased frame rate. </p>

<p>Finally, if you’re viewing the footage on an older device, try using a newer device. The newer device should be able to keep up with the frame rate of the footage and result in a smoother playback. </p>

<h2>Tips on Avoiding Slow Motion Playback</h2>

If you’re recording in slow motion, make sure that you’re viewing the footage on a device that can handle the increased frame rate.
