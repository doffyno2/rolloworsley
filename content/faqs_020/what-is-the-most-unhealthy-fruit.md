Fruits are an important part of a healthy diet. They provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber that are necessary for our bodies to function properly. But not all fruits are created equal. Some are healthier than others and some can even be detrimental to your health if consumed in excess. So what is the most unhealthy fruit? 

<h2>Fruit Nutrient Profiles</h2>

When looking at the nutrient profiles of different fruits, there are certain factors that can be used to determine which ones are the most unhealthy. These include sugar content, fat content, and calorie content. Fruits that are high in sugar, fat, and calories are usually considered to be the least healthy.

When looking at the sugar content of different fruits, it can be helpful to compare them to other foods.
