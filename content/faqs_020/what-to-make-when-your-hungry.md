<h2>Quick Snacks</h2>

<p>When you're feeling peckish and need a quick snack, there are plenty of options. If you're short on time, consider something like a smoothie.

<h2>Nutritious Meals</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a more substantial meal, it's still possible to make something tasty and nutritious. Consider making a stir-fry with fresh vegetables and lean proteins. This is a great way to get all the vitamins and minerals you need without having to spend a lot of time in the kitchen. Another option is to make a salad. Salads are incredibly versatile, so you can customize them to your tastes. You can add ingredients like nuts, seeds, or fruits for extra flavor and texture.</p>
