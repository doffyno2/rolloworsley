Do use a conversational tone.



<p>When you submit an immigration application to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), you must include a filing fee. This fee can be paid by check or money order. If you choose to pay by check, it is important to understand when the USCIS will cash the check.</p>

<h2>Understanding USCIS Fees</h2>

<p>The USCIS fees vary depending on the type of application you are submitting. For example, if you are applying for naturalization, the fee is $725. If you are applying for a green card, the fee is $1,060. Always double-check the fee amount before you submit your application to ensure that the correct amount is included.</p>

<h2>When Will USCIS Cash the Check?</h2>

<p>When you submit your application and fee to the USCIS, the agency will typically cash your check within two to three weeks. This time frame is based on the processing times for applications that are submitted to the USCIS. Once the agency has cashed your check, it will be processed and the application will be reviewed.</p>

<h2>What If the Check Is Rejected?</h2>

<p>In some cases, the USCIS may reject your check if it is not properly filled out or if the amount is incorrect. If this happens, you will need to submit a new check with the correct information and fee amount. The USCIS will then cash this check and process your application.</p>

<h2>Tips for Submitting Checks to the USCIS</h2>

<p>When submitting a check to the USCIS, make sure you follow these tips:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Always include the correct fee amount on the check.</li>
	<li>Make sure the check is written out to the "U.S. Department of Homeland Security."</li>
	<li>Include your name and Alien Registration Number on the check.</li>
	<li>Do not send cash.</li>
</ul>

<p>By following these tips, you can ensure that your check will not be rejected and that it will be cashed in a timely manner.</p>
