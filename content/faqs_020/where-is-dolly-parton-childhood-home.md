<p>Dolly Parton is an iconic singer, songwriter, actress, and philanthropist. She rose to fame in the late 1960s and has been an ever-present figure in the music industry ever since. Her music has been an inspiration to many people around the world, and her career has spanned over five decades. But where was her childhood home?</p>

<p>Dolly Parton was born on January 19, 1946 in Pittman Center, a small mountain community in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. Her parents, Robert and Avie Lee, had eight children, and Dolly was the fourth. Dolly's father worked as a sharecropper and timber cutter, while her mother took care of the children and the house. Dolly's childhood was spent in the small cabin in Pittman Center.</p>

<p>The cabin was a two-room log building with a dirt floor and no running water or electricity. It had two windows and a door, but no indoor plumbing. Dolly's family had to haul water from a nearby creek for cooking, cleaning, and bathing. The cabin was heated by a wood-burning stove, and lit by oil lamps or candles. Dolly and her siblings would often sleep together in the same bed.</p>

<p>Despite the harsh conditions, the Parton family was close-knit and happy. Dolly and her siblings spent their days playing in the woods and singing along to their father's guitar. Dolly was particularly fond of singing, and as a young girl she would often perform at local churches and gatherings.</p>

<p>When Dolly was 11, her family moved to a larger home in nearby Sevierville. She and her siblings had to help with the move, which took two days to complete. Dolly and her family continued to live in the Sevierville home until she moved to Nashville at the age of 23.</p>

<p>Dolly Parton's childhood home in Pittman Center is still standing today, and has been renovated and restored. It is now open to the public as a historical attraction and museum. Visitors can take a guided tour of the cabin, which includes a look at the kitchen, living room, and bedroom.
