What is the White Part of Egg Called?

For many of us, eggs are a staple ingredient when it comes to preparing meals. When you crack open an egg, you'll find two distinct parts—the white and the yolk. But what is the white part of the egg called?

The white part of an egg is called the albumen. The albumen is made up of protein and water, and it makes up the majority of an egg. The albumen is a protective layer for the yolk and is made up of several layers. The innermost layer of the albumen is the vitelline membrane, which is a thin and semi-permeable membrane that keeps the yolk from drying out.



Eggs are a staple ingredient for many of us when it comes to preparing meals. When you crack open an egg, you’ll see two distinct parts – the white and the yolk. But what is the white part of the egg called?

The white part of an egg is called the albumen. It’s made up of protein and water, and it makes up the majority of an egg. The albumen is a protective layer for the yolk and consists of several layers. The innermost layer of the albumen is the vitelline membrane, a thin and semi-permeable membrane that prevents the yolk from drying out.

<h2>What is Albumen?</h2>

Albumen is the scientific name for egg whites. Albumen is made up of almost 90% water and 10% protein. The proteins that make up albumen are ovalbumin, ovotransferrin, ovomucoid, and lysozyme. These proteins are responsible for the thick and viscous texture of egg whites.

The proteins in albumen also offer many health benefits. Ovalbumin is a high-quality source of protein that can help build muscle and provide energy. Ovotransferrin helps with iron absorption, while ovomucoid can help with digestion and reduce inflammation. Lysozyme helps to protect the egg from bacteria and other potentially harmful microorganisms.

<h2>What is the Function of Albumen?</h2>

Albumen helps to protect the yolk from damage and dehydration. It also helps to keep the egg from spoiling by preventing bacteria from entering and multiplying in the egg.

Albumen also helps to trap air and water vapor, allowing the egg to expand when heated. This expansion helps give eggs their characteristic texture and shape.

<h2>What are the Different Types of Albumen?</h2>

The type of albumen found in an egg varies depending on the age of the egg. Fresh eggs have thick and viscous albumen, while older eggs have thin and watery albumen.

The albumen in fresh eggs is made up of four distinct layers. The innermost layer is the vitelline membrane, followed by the inner thick albumen, the outer thick albumen, and the outer thin albumen.

The outer thin albumen is the most watery part of the egg white. It is mostly composed of water and a small amount of protein. It is also the part of the egg that is most susceptible to bacterial contamination.

<h2>What is Albumen Used For?</h2>

Albumen is used in many recipes, from baking to making meringue. Its high protein content makes it a great source of nutrition, and its ability to trap air makes it a useful tool for creating airy and light desserts.

Albumen can also be used to make foam, which is often used in cocktails and other drinks. Albumen can also be used to clarify liquids, such as beer and wine.
