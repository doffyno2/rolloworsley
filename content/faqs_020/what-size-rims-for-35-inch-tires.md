<p>When you are looking for the perfect set of wheels for your vehicle, it is important to get the right size wheels. Choosing the wrong size can have a negative impact on the performance of your vehicle and can even be dangerous. When it comes to selecting the right size rims for your 35 inch tires, there are a few things you need to consider.</p>

<p>First and foremost, you need to make sure that the rims you select are compatible with the size and type of tires you have. Most tires are designed to fit specific rim sizes, so it is important to make sure that the rims you select are compatible with your tires. The tire manufacturer should be able to provide you with the correct rim size for your tires.</p>

<p>Once you have determined the correct size rims for your 35 inch tires, you must also consider the offset of the rims. The offset of a rim is the distance between the hub or center of the wheel and the edge of the rim. This distance can affect the handling, stability, and performance of your vehicle. The wrong offset can cause excessive wear on the tires, increased steering effort, and decreased ride quality.</p>

<p>When selecting the offset of your rims, you should also consider the type of driving you do. If you are a performance driver, you may want to choose a lower offset for increased grip and better handling. If you are a casual driver, you may want to choose a higher offset for more comfortable driving and better ride quality.</p>

<p>Lastly, you should consider the overall aesthetic of the wheels. The style and finish of the wheels can have a big impact on the look of your vehicle. There are many different styles and finishes to choose from, so make sure to take your time and select the style that best suits your vehicle.</p>
