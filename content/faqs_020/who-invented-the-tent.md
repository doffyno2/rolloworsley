The first known permanent tents were constructed by the ancient Egyptians, who used them for shelter during religious ceremonies and festivals. These tents were made from linen or papyrus and were typically decorated with colorful images and symbols.

The Greeks and Romans also used tents, albeit for more practical and military purposes. The Greeks often used tents to provide shelter for their soldiers during long campaigns, while the Romans used tents for shelter during their conquests.
