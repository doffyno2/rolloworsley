Saunas are a great way to relax and relieve stress, but knowing what to wear in a sauna can be confusing. It's important to dress appropriately for a sauna session to ensure your safety and comfort.

<h2>What is a Sauna?</h2>

A sauna is an enclosed room or space that is heated to a high temperature, usually between 70 and 100 degrees Celsius. The heat is created by dry or wet steam, and the air is often circulated by an electric heater or wood stove.
