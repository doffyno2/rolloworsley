<p>A century is a period of 100 years. It can also refer to an era or a style of art, music, literature, or architecture, which lasts for a hundred years or more. The term century has been in use since at least the 15th century and is derived from the Latin word centuria, which means one hundred. </p>

<p>Centuries are commonly divided into decades, or ten-year periods. The 20th century, for example, is generally accepted as starting in 1901 and ending in 2000. Each decade can be further divided into two five-year periods.</p>

<h2>How Long Does a Century Last?</h2>

<p>A century typically lasts 100 years. However, there are different interpretations of the length of a century, depending on how it is measured. Some people define a century as starting with the year 1 and ending in the year 100, while others define a century as starting in the year 0 and ending in the year 99.</p>

<p>There are also various interpretations of centuries in different cultures and religions. For example, some cultures consider a century as ending after 99 years, while others consider it to end after 100 years. In some religions, the century ends after 99 years, while in others it ends after 100 years.</p>

<h2>How Is a Century Used?</h2>

<p>Centuries are often used to mark the passage of time and to denote certain events or periods. For example, the 20th century is often associated with the development of technology, the rise of the Internet, and the beginning of the Information Age. The 19th century is often associated with the Industrial Revolution and the Enlightenment.</p>

<p>Centuries are also used in historical research and in genealogical studies. For example, a historian might study the events of the 20th century, or a genealogist might trace a family's history through the centuries.</p>

<h2>How Do You Calculate a Century?</h2>

<p>To calculate a century, you need to know the year in which it began and the year in which it ended. For example, to calculate the 20th century, you would subtract 1900 from 2000. This would give you 100, which is the number of years in a century.</p>

<p>If you want to calculate the exact number of days in a century, you would need to know the exact day and month of the beginning and ending years. This would involve counting the days in between those dates. For example, if the century began on January 1st, 1900 and ended on December 31st, 2000, then there would be 36,525 days in that century.</p>
