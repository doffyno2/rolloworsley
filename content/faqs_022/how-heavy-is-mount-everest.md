Mount Everest stands tall as the highest mountain in the world, and it is also one of the most iconic landmarks on the planet. It is no surprise that many people are curious about how much this giant mass of rock and ice actually weighs. In this article, we will take a look at the weight of Mount Everest, and explore some of the factors that contribute to its overall mass.

<h2>What is the Weight of Mount Everest?</h2>

The exact weight of Mount Everest is impossible to determine, as its mass is constantly changing due to weather, erosion, and other factors. However, scientists have estimated that the mountain weighs around 167 million tons. This is the equivalent of around 6 million elephants, or more than 10,000 Boeing 747s.

<h2>What Factors Contribute to the Weight of Mount Everest?</h2>

Mount Everest is made up of many different components that contribute to its overall mass. Firstly, the mountain is composed of rock, ice, and snow. The rock and ice make up the bulk of the mountain's mass, while the snow is a smaller but still significant contributor. 

The terrain of the mountain also affects its weight. The higher the elevation, the thinner the air, and the less weight the mountain can support. This means that the higher up you go, the lighter the mountain becomes. 

The weather is also a major factor in the weight of Mount Everest. Heavy rain and snow can add significant mass to the mountain, while strong winds can strip away snow and ice from its peak.

<h2>How Does the Weight of Mount Everest Compare to Other Mountains?</h2>

While Mount Everest is the highest mountain in the world, it is not the heaviest. That distinction belongs to Mauna Loa, a volcano located in Hawaii. Mauna Loa is estimated to weigh around 220 million tons, making it around 33 million tons heavier than Mount Everest.
