<p>Weightlifting is an incredibly effective way to burn calories and get into shape, but not everyone knows just how many calories you can burn lifting weights. The answer to this question depends on a few factors, including the type of weightlifting you’re doing, the intensity of your workout, and your age and fitness level. To help you better understand exactly how many calories you can burn, we’ve put together a detailed guide on the topic.</p>

<h2>How Many Calories Does Weightlifting Burn?</h2>

<p>The number of calories you burn lifting weights will depend on the type of weightlifting you’re doing, your intensity level, and your age and fitness level. On average, a person can burn between 200-400 calories per hour, depending on these factors. If you’re engaging in more intense weightlifting, such as powerlifting or Olympic weightlifting, you can burn even more calories.</p>

<h2>Factors That Influence Calories Burned</h2>

<p>There are several different factors that can influence the number of calories you burn while weightlifting. These include:</p>

<h3>Type of Weightlifting</h3>

<p>The type of weightlifting you’re engaging in will have a big impact on the number of calories you burn. For instance, powerlifting and Olympic weightlifting are more intense forms of weightlifting that require more energy, leading to more calories burned. Meanwhile, lighter weightlifting exercises such as bodyweight exercises and traditional weightlifting will burn fewer calories.</p>

<h3>Intensity Level</h3>

<p>The intensity of your weightlifting workouts will also have an impact on the number of calories you burn. If you’re pushing yourself hard and challenging yourself with more reps and heavier weights, you’ll burn more calories than if you’re taking it easy. For example, a powerlifter lifting heavy weights for low reps will burn more calories than a bodybuilder lifting lighter weights for more reps.</p>

<h3>Age and Fitness Level</h3>

<p>Your age and fitness level can also influence how many calories you burn while weightlifting. Generally speaking, the younger and more fit you are, the more calories you’ll burn during your workouts. If you’re older or less fit, you’ll probably burn fewer calories.</p>

<h2>Tips for Burning More Calories When Weightlifting</h2>

<p>If you want to burn more calories when weightlifting, there are a few simple tips you can follow. Here are a few of the best tips:</p>

<h3>Increase the Intensity</h3>

<p>The easiest way to burn more calories when weightlifting is to increase the intensity of your workouts. Push yourself harder by lifting heavier weights or doing more reps. This will raise your heart rate and make your body work harder, leading to more calories burned.</p>

<h3>Decrease Your Rest Times</h3>

<p>Resting between sets is an important part of weightlifting, but if you want to burn more calories, you can reduce your rest times. This will keep your heart rate elevated and ensure that you’re burning more calories during your workouts.</p>

<h3>Incorporate Cardio</h3>

<p>Incorporating some cardio into your weightlifting routine is another great way to boost the number of calories you burn. Try adding a few minutes of cardio before or after your weightlifting session to burn even more calories.</p>
