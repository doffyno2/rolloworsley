Apex Legends is the latest battle royale sensation that has taken the world by storm. Players are flocking to the game to experience its unique blend of intense combat and innovative team-based shooter mechanics. But, one of the most important things to understand before jumping into Apex is how much health each player has and how to best manage it. In this article, we'll discuss how Apex Legends handles player health and what strategies you should use to stay alive on the battlefield.

<h2>How Much Health Does Each Player Have in Apex Legends?</h2>

In Apex Legends, each player has a base health of 100 HP (hit points). When you take damage, your health decreases and when you heal, it increases. Unlike in other battle royale games, most of the time you won't be able to restore your health to its maximum level in Apex Legends. This is because the game has a built-in healing cap of 75 HP.

<h2>What Are the Different Ways to Heal in Apex Legends?</h2>

There are three main ways to heal in Apex Legends: using healing items, using a healing drone, and using your teammate’s healing abilities. 

<h3>Healing Items</h3>

Healing items are consumable items that can be found scattered around the map. These items are divided into two categories: health kits and shield cells. Health kits restore 25 HP and shield cells restore 25 points of shield (which acts as a second layer of health). 

<h3>Healing Drone</h3>

The healing drone is a unique item that can be found in certain areas of the map. When activated, it will hover around you and automatically heal you as you take damage. The healing drone can restore a maximum of 25 HP. 

<h3>Teammates' Healing Abilities</h3>

If you're playing with a team, then you can take advantage of your teammates' healing abilities. Every character in Apex Legends has a unique healing ability that can restore health to teammates. For example, Lifeline can heal her teammates with her “D.O.C. Heal Drone” and Wraith can restore a small amount of health with her “Into the Void” ability.

<h2>What Strategies Should I Use to Manage My Health in Apex Legends?</h2>

Managing your health in Apex Legends is key to staying alive on the battlefield. Here are some tips and strategies you should use to stay alive: 

<h3>Be Wary of Taking Damage</h3>

In Apex Legends, it's important to be careful when taking damage. You should always try to take cover when possible and avoid taking unnecessary damage. This is especially important when you're low on health and you don't have any healing items or a healing drone. 

<h3>Use Healing Items and the Healing Drone Effectively</h3>

When you have access to healing items or a healing drone, it's important to use them effectively. You should try to use them when you're taking damage and keep an eye on your health bar to make sure you don't overextend yourself.

<h3>Communicate With Your Teammates</h3>

If you're playing with a team, it's important to communicate with your teammates. You should let your team know when you're low on health and when you need help. This will help ensure that your team is able to provide the most effective healing.
