How Many Bulls Die From Rodeo Riding?

Rodeo riding is a popular spectator sport, but it is often criticized for the dangers it poses to the animals involved. Unfortunately, the bulls used in rodeo competitions are subjected to a range of physical and psychological stressors, leading to some fatalities. In this article, we explore the risks posed to bulls during rodeo events and how many of them die as a result.



Rodeo riding is a competitive sport that involves cowboys and cowgirls riding a bull or bronc (a horse) for a set amount of time. Riders must stay on the animal for as long as possible, using only one hand to hold onto a rope. Competitions are judged on the rider’s control, balance, and showmanship.



In order to give riders a better chance at staying on the animal, bulls and broncs are often subjected to a range of physical and psychological stressors. This can include electric prods, flank straps, and spurs, which can cause the animals pain and distress. Additionally, the animals are often kept in tight spaces and denied food and water.



Unfortunately, the stress of rodeo riding can be too much for some bulls, leading to fatalities. According to PETA, more than 70 bulls have died during rodeo events between 1999 and 2009. However, the exact number is difficult to track because injuries and deaths are not always reported.



Bulls used in rodeo events are at risk of sustaining a range of injuries. These can include broken ribs, broken necks, and head trauma. Bulls can also suffer from “broken heart syndrome”, a condition caused by the stress of performing in rodeos.



The debate over bull riding remains heated, with some arguing that it is an inhumane form of entertainment. Animal rights activists have called for an end to rodeo events, citing the risks posed to the bulls. Others argue that the sport is an important part of American culture and that the animals are treated humanely.
