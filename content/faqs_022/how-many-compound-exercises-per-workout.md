<p>Many individuals who are just getting into fitness or are looking to up their game in the gym are often unsure of how many exercises they should be doing per workout. Compound exercises are those which work multiple muscle groups at the same time, and they are widely considered to be the most effective way to build muscle and strength. However, knowing how many compound exercises to do in a workout is essential for getting the most out of your efforts.</p>

<p>It is important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to the number of compound exercises per workout. The number of exercises you do and the number of sets and reps will depend on your goals, fitness level, and experience. However, there are some general guidelines that can help you determine how many compound exercises you should be doing in a workout.</p>

<h2>Factors to Consider When Determining Compound Exercises Per Workout</h2>

<p>When deciding how many compound exercises you should be doing in each workout, there are several factors that you should consider. These include your current fitness level, your goals, the amount of time you have available, and the type of workout you are doing. Additionally, your age and medical history should also be taken into consideration.</p>

<h2>Beginners</h2>

<p>If you are new to working out and are just starting out, it is recommended that you do 2-3 compound exercises per workout, with 2-3 sets of 8-12 reps. This is a good starting point as it will allow your body to get used to the movements and prevent injuries. As you become more comfortable and familiar with the exercises, you can start to add more exercises, sets, and reps.</p>

<h2>Intermediate and Advanced Lifters</h2>

<p>Intermediate and advanced lifters can usually handle more volume, so they may want to add more compound exercises to their workouts. It is recommended that intermediate and advanced lifters do 4-6 exercises per workout, with 3-4 sets of 8-12 reps. This will help to maximize the benefits of the exercises and ensure that you are pushing your body to its limits.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Your goals will also play a role in determining how many compound exercises you should do in a workout. For example, if you are looking to build muscle, then you will want to focus on doing more sets and reps, as this will help to maximize muscle growth. If you are looking to burn fat, then you will want to focus on doing more exercises with fewer sets and reps.</p>

<h2>Time</h2>

<p>The amount of time you have available to devote to your workout will also affect how many compound exercises you can do. If you only have a short amount of time, then it is best to focus on doing fewer exercises with higher intensity. This will help to maximize the benefits of your workout in the time that you have available.</p>

<h2>Type of Workout</h2>

<p>The type of workout you are doing will also affect how many compound exercises you should do. For example, if you are doing a full-body workout, then you should focus on doing more exercises to ensure that all muscle groups are being worked. If you are doing a split routine, then you can focus on fewer exercises as you will be focusing on specific muscle groups during each workout.</p>

<h2>Age and Medical History</h2>

<p>Finally, your age and medical history should also be taken into consideration when deciding how many compound exercises to do in a workout. If you are over the age of 40 or have any pre-existing medical conditions, then you may want to start with fewer exercises and focus on lighter weights. This will help to ensure that you stay safe and injury-free.</p>
