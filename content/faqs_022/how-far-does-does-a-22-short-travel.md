<p>When it comes to shooting, the 22 short is one of the most popular cartridges used by enthusiasts and professionals alike. It is a small but powerful round that has a variety of uses, from target shooting to hunting small game. But just how far can a 22 short travel? In this article, we'll discuss the range and accuracy of the 22 short and how it performs in different scenarios.</p>

<h2>The Basics of the 22 Short</h2>

<p>The 22 short is a centerfire cartridge that is based on the .22 rimfire cartridge. While the rimfire cartridge only contains primer, the centerfire cartridge contains an additional charge of gunpowder. This additional charge gives the 22 short a greater range and accuracy than its rimfire counterpart. The 22 short is a low-powered round, with muzzle velocity ranging from 1050-1250 feet per second and energy ranging from 64-84 foot-pounds.</p>

<h2>Range and Accuracy of the 22 Short</h2>

<p>When it comes to range and accuracy, the 22 short is an excellent choice for target shooting and small game hunting. At typical hunting distances, the 22 short is accurate enough to consistently hit small game such as rabbits, squirrels, and other small game animals. At longer ranges, the 22 short is still accurate enough for target shooting, but its low power and small size means that it is not suitable for hunting larger game animals.</p>

<p>When shooting the 22 short, it is important to remember that the cartridge is not designed to travel long distances. The maximum effective range of the 22 short is around 100 yards, with the maximum range being around 200 yards. Beyond this range, the bullet will begin to drop significantly and accuracy will suffer.</p>

<h2>Types of 22 Short Ammunition</h2>

<p>There are several types of 22 short ammunition available to shooters. The most common type of 22 short ammunition is the standard lead round nose, which is a full metal jacketed round. This type of round is designed for target shooting, and is not suitable for hunting. There are also hollow point bullets available, which are designed for hunting small game. Hollow point bullets expand upon impact, creating a larger wound channel and more tissue damage.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are "magnum" loads available for the 22 short, which are designed to increase the muzzle velocity and range of the cartridge. These magnum loads are not suitable for use in all firearms, and should only be used in firearms specifically designed for magnum loads.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The 22 short is a low-powered but accurate cartridge that is suitable for target shooting and hunting small game. Its maximum effective range is around 100 yards, but its accuracy begins to suffer beyond this range. There are several types of 22 short ammunition available, including standard full metal jacketed rounds, hollow point rounds, and magnum loads. When used properly, the 22 short can be an effective and accurate cartridge for target shooting and small game hunting.</p>
