Kan Jam is a fast-paced, fun game that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. The game is played with two teams of two players each and two targets (Kans). The objective of the game is for a player on a team to throw a Frisbee at the Kan in order to score points. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Kan Jam is a great game for groups of friends and family. It is a great way to get outside, get some exercise, and have a good time. But before you can start playing, you need to know the rules and how to set up the game. One of the most important questions you need to answer is: How far apart should the Kans be placed?

<h2>How to Set Up the Kans</h2>

The first step in setting up the Kans is to find an open area that is large enough to accommodate two Kans. You will also need to make sure that the area is free of any obstacles, such as trees or buildings. Once you have found the perfect spot, it is time to set up the Kans. 

The Kans should be placed 25 feet apart from each other. This is the official distance that is recommended by the Kan Jam manufacturer. You may choose to adjust the distance depending on the skill level of the players. 

<h2>How to Measure the Distance</h2>

Once you have found an area that is free of any obstacles, you will need to measure the distance between the two Kans. You can do this by using a measuring tape, or you can use a yardstick. If you do not have either of these items, you can use your own two feet to measure the distance. Just stand at one Kan and then walk to the other, counting your steps as you go. 

<h2>Kan Jam Variations</h2>

If you are looking to add some variation to your game of Kan Jam, there are several options available. For example, you can change the distance between the Kans to make the game more challenging. You can also set up multiple Kans in different locations to give the game an added level of difficulty. 

<h2>Kan Jam Safety</h2>

When playing Kan Jam, it is important to ensure that all players are wearing eye protection. This is especially important if the game is being played in an area with a lot of traffic or other hazards. It is also important to make sure that the area is free of any sharp objects that may be in the way.
