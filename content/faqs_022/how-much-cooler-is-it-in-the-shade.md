<p>In the summer months, when the sun is at its hottest, it can be unbearable to be outside for long periods of time. But the good news is that there is a way to make the heat more bearable: shade. But just how much cooler is it in the shade?</p> 

<p>It’s a common misconception that shade is the same temperature as the air. In reality, shade can be significantly cooler than the air, as much as 20-30 degrees cooler! This is because shade is created when the sun’s rays are blocked from reaching an object, thus cooling the air around it. Additionally, shade can protect you from harmful UV rays, which can cause sunburns and other skin damage.</p> 

<h2>What Factors Affect Shade Temperature?</h2>

<p>There are several factors that can affect how much cooler it is when you step into the shade. The most important factor is the amount of sunlight that is blocked by the shade. The more sunlight is blocked, the more effective the shade will be.</p> 

<p>The type of shade also plays a role. For example, a tree will provide more shade than a wall, since the leaves of the tree will catch the sun’s rays and disperse them. However, a wall will still provide some protection from the sun’s rays, so it is still better than nothing.</p> 

<p>The time of day also has an effect on how much cooler it is in the shade. During the hottest part of the day, the sun is at its highest point in the sky, and thus there is less shade. However, as the sun moves lower in the sky, there is more shade, and thus it is cooler. Additionally, the time of year can also have an effect, as during the summer months the sun is higher in the sky and thus there is less shade.</p> 

<h2>How Can You Take Advantage Of Shade?</h2>

<p>The best way to take advantage of shade is to plan your outdoor activities accordingly. If you know that you’ll be outdoors during the hottest part of the day, try to plan your activities so that you’ll be in the shade. For example, if you’re going to the beach, try to find a spot that is in the shade of a tree or a building, or set up an umbrella or a beach tent.</p> 

<p>You can also take advantage of shade by choosing clothing that will keep you cooler in the sun. Light, loose-fitting clothing made of natural fabrics such as cotton or linen will help keep you cool. Additionally, wearing a hat and sunglasses will help protect you from the sun’s rays.</p> 

<h2>How Can Shade Help You Save Money?</h2>

<p>By taking advantage of shade, you can save money on your energy bills. During the summer months, the sun’s rays can heat up your house, causing your air conditioning system to work harder and use more energy. By strategically placing trees, shrubs, and awnings around your house, you can block out the sun’s rays and keep your house cooler, thus reducing your energy usage.</p> 

<p>You can also save money by planting trees near your house. Trees can provide shade, but they can also help reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool your home. During the summer months, the leaves of the tree will act as a natural cooling system, keeping the air around your house cooler. During the winter months, the leaves will help block out the cold air, thus reducing the amount of energy needed to keep your house warm.</p>
