The answer to the question of “how much does a reusable plastic water bottle weigh?” is not a simple one. The weight of a reusable plastic water bottle will vary depending on the size, type, and material of the bottle. 

<h2>Different Types and Materials of Plastic Water Bottles</h2>

PET plastic is a lightweight plastic that is often used for single-use water bottles. It is lightweight and shatter-resistant, making it ideal for single-use bottles. 

PC plastic is a more durable and shatter-resistant plastic, and it is often used for reusable water bottles. It is more expensive than PET plastic, but it is also more durable.
