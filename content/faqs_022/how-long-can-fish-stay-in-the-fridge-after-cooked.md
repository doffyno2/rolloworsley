<p>Cooked fish is one of the most popular seafood dishes. It is easy to cook, tastes great and is packed with essential nutrients including protein, vitamins, and minerals. It is also a great source of omega-3 fatty acids which are good for heart health. But if you have just cooked your fish, have you ever asked yourself how long can you store it in the fridge?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on several factors such as the type of fish that you cooked, the method used to cook it, and the way it is stored in the fridge. Here we will discuss the best ways to store cooked fish in the fridge and how long it can last.</p>

<h2>Types of Fish</h2>

<p>The type of fish you cooked will make a huge difference in how long it can stay in the fridge. Generally, fish with a high fat content like salmon, mackerel, and trout can stay in the fridge for up to three days. Fish with a low fat content like cod and haddock can last up to two days in the fridge.</p>

<h2>Cooking Method</h2>

<p>The method used to cook the fish also affects how long it can be stored in the fridge. If the fish was boiled, steamed, or baked, it can last up to three days. However, if the fish was fried, it should only be stored for up to two days.</p>

<h2>Storing Cooked Fish</h2>

<p>To ensure that your cooked fish remains safe to eat, it is important to store it correctly. The best way to store cooked fish is to wrap it tightly in an airtight container or plastic wrap and place it in the coldest part of the fridge. This will help keep the fish fresh for longer.</p>

<p>It is also important to ensure that the cooked fish is not stored too close to raw meat or other foods that can cause cross-contamination. This is especially true if you are storing cooked fish in a container or plastic wrap since any juices that leak out can contaminate other foods in the fridge.</p>

<h2>How to Tell if Cooked Fish Has Gone Bad</h2>

<p>It is important to be aware of the signs that cooked fish has gone bad. If the fish is discolored or has a slimy texture, it is best to discard it. You should also avoid eating cooked fish if it has a strong smell or if it has been in the fridge for longer than three days.</p>
