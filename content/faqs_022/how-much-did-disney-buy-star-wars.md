<p>In October 2012, Disney announced that it was acquiring Lucasfilm Ltd. for $4.05 billion. This acquisition included all of the existing Star Wars films, television shows, books, merchandise, and the rights to produce new films and shows. The deal was finalized on December 21, 2012, and since then, Disney has released two new films in the series, with several more planned.</p>

<p>The acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd. was a major deal for Disney, as it allowed them to expand their already-impressive portfolio of franchises. The Star Wars franchise is one of the most beloved in the world, and it has had a long and successful run in theaters, books, and other media outlets. Disney was eager to tap into the tremendous potential of the franchise, and the purchase was seen as a wise investment for the company.</p>

<p>Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm Ltd. was the largest purchase in the company's history, and it was seen as a major risk. However, Disney was confident that their purchase would pay off in the long run, and it certainly has. The first Star Wars film released by Disney, "Star Wars: The Force Awakens," grossed $2 billion at the box office and is the highest-grossing film of all time. Meanwhile, "Star Wars: The Last Jedi" grossed $1.3 billion, and "Solo: A Star Wars Story" grossed $392 million.</p>

<p>Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. has proven to be an incredibly lucrative investment. The company has used the Star Wars franchise to launch a plethora of new products, from toys and video games to books and TV shows. In addition, Disney has also used the franchise to create theme parks, such as Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland and Disney World. The success of these products and attractions has made Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. a huge success.</p>

<h2>What Benefits Has Disney Gained From Buying Star Wars?</h2>
<p>Disney has gained a number of benefits from their purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the Star Wars franchise. The first, and most obvious, benefit is the increased revenue that the franchise has brought in. As mentioned above, the first two Star Wars films released by Disney have both been massive box office successes, and the franchise has also spawned a number of successful products and attractions. This has allowed Disney to expand its portfolio and become an even bigger player in the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>In addition to increased revenue, Disney has also gained a number of other benefits from the purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. The franchise has brought in a new generation of fans, as well as increased brand recognition for Disney. The franchise has also allowed Disney to tap into new markets, such as Asian markets, which had been largely untapped before.</p>

<p>Finally, Disney has been able to use the Star Wars franchise to create a cohesive universe across all of its products and attractions. This has allowed the company to create a more immersive experience for its customers, and it has helped to increase customer loyalty.</p>

<h2>What Challenges Has Disney Faced Since Buying Star Wars?</h2>
<p>Despite all of the benefits that Disney has gained from its purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd., the company has also faced a number of challenges. One of the biggest challenges has been the reaction of some fans to the new films. While many critics and fans have praised the new films, there have been a number of vocal critics who have voiced their displeasure with the direction that the franchise has taken. This has led to some criticism of Disney’s handling of the franchise.</p>

<p>In addition, Disney has also faced criticism for its handling of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. This was a collection of books, comics, and other media that was created prior to Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. Disney has since decided to disregard most of the Expanded Universe in favor of its own storytelling.</p>

<p>Finally, Disney has also faced criticism for its handling of the Star Wars video games. While the company has released some successful titles, such as Star Wars Battlefront and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, many fans have felt that the games have not lived up to the quality of the films. This has led to some criticism of Disney’s handling of the franchise.</p>

<h2>What Is The Future Of Star Wars Under Disney?</h2>
<p>The future of Star Wars under Disney is still uncertain. The company has released two successful films so far, but there are still a number of unanswered questions. Will Disney continue to focus on the Skywalker Saga, or will they explore other corners of the Star Wars universe? Will they continue to produce video games, or will they focus on other forms of entertainment? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, though: Disney’s purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the Star Wars franchise was one of the smartest investments the company has ever made. The franchise has proven to be incredibly successful, and it has allowed Disney to expand its reach into new markets and create a cohesive universe across all of its products. As long as Disney continues to handle the franchise with care, Star Wars will remain one of the most successful and beloved franchises in the world.</p>
