<p>If you've ever had your eyes dilated during a routine eye exam, you may have been surprised by the intensity of the light afterwards. You may also have been surprised to find out that it can take a few hours for your eyes to adjust to the light again. This process, known as undilation, is an important part of recovery after an eye exam. In this article, we'll explain what you can expect from the process and how long it might take for your eyes to undilate.</p>

<h2>What is Dilation?</h2>

<p>Dilation is a procedure that eye doctors use to examine the back of the eye. During this procedure, the doctor will use special drops to widen the pupil and allow for a better view of the inside of the eye. The drops are usually applied in both eyes, and the effects can last for up to three hours. During this time, it can be difficult to see clearly, as the pupil is wide and light sensitive.</p>

<h2>What Happens During Undilation?</h2>

<p>During the undilation process, the eye gradually returns to its normal size. This process can take anywhere from one to three hours, depending on the individual. During this time, it is important to avoid bright light, as it can be uncomfortable and exacerbate the undilation process. It is also important to avoid any strenuous activity, as this can cause the eyes to become red and irritated.</p>

Additionally, you can try using artificial tears to help lubricate your eyes and reduce irritation.</p>

<h2>What Are the Risks of Undilation?</h2>
