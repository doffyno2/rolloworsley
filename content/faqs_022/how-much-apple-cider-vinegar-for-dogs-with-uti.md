<p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common problem for dogs, and one of the natural remedies that can be used to treat these infections is apple cider vinegar (ACV). But how much apple cider vinegar should you give your dog for a UTI?</p>

<h2>Why Use Apple Cider Vinegar for UTIs in Dogs?</h2>
