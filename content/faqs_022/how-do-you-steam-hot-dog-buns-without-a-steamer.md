Hot dogs are a quintessential summertime snack, but they can’t be enjoyed without the perfect bun. Soft, steamed buns are the ideal vessel for any hot dog, but not everyone has a steamer. Fortunately, there are several ways to steam hot dog buns without using a steamer. 

<h2>Using a Microwave</h2>

<h2>Using a Pan with a Lid</h2>

If you don’t have a steamer or a microwave, you can still steam the buns in a pan. To do this, you’ll need a pan with a lid. Place the buns in the pan and add 1/4 cup of water. Put the lid on the pan and steam the buns over medium heat for a few minutes. The buns should be soft and fluffy when they’re done.

<h2>Using an Oven</h2>
