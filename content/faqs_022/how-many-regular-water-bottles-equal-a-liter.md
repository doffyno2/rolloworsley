<p>When it comes to measuring liquids, the metric system is the preferred system of measurement across the world. The metric system is a decimalised system of measurement, meaning units increase and decrease by a factor of 10. One of the most commonly used units of measurement is the liter, which is a unit of volume. A liter is equivalent to 1,000 milliliters, and is often used to measure fluids such as water. But how many regular water bottles equal a liter? Let’s take a look.</p>
