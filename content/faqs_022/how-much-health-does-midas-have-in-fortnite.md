<p>Fortnite is one of the most popular battle royale games in the world, and it has been around since 2017. As one of the most beloved characters in the game, Midas has been a fan favorite since the end of the first season. With his golden guns, Midas is one of the most powerful characters in the game and many players want to know how much health does Midas have in Fortnite. </p>

<p>Midas is one of the few characters that have a set amount of health in the game. Most characters in Fortnite have a base health of 100 and can be increased with the use of shields. Midas, however, has a set amount of health that will never change. He has 200 health which is double that of a normal character.</p> 

<p>There are some benefits to having a higher health pool like Midas. It means that he can take more damage than other characters and can survive longer in a gunfight. It also means that he can stay alive longer if he is caught in the storm. His health pool also makes him one of the most difficult characters to take down in the game.</p>

<p>Midas' health also helps him to be one of the most sought after characters in Fortnite. His high health pool makes him very difficult to kill, and as a result, many players want to make sure they have him on their team. His health also makes him one of the most valuable characters in the game, as he can be used to protect players from the storm or from other players.</p>

<p>Despite Midas' high health pool, he is still vulnerable to certain weapons and abilities. For example, if you hit him with a rocket launcher or an explosive weapon, his health will be reduced by a significant amount.

<p>Midas also cannot use any of the healing abilities in the game, such as the Slurp Juice or the Chug Splash. These abilities are only available to characters with a lower health pool, and Midas does not qualify. Therefore, if Midas takes damage, his only option is to use a shield to restore some of his health.</p>
