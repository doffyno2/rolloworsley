<p>Pumas are one of the most iconic predators of the Americas, with their beautiful coats of many colors, the power of their athletic bodies, and their alert and attentive faces. They are a symbol of the wild and untamed nature of the continent and its people. Unfortunately, their numbers have been dwindling for many years. So, how many pumas are left in the world?</p>

<h2>The Puma Population: A Global Overview</h2>

<p>Pumas, also known as cougars, mountain lions, or panthers, are found in a variety of habitats throughout the Americas. They live in the Andes Mountains of South America, in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, and in the United States, particularly in the western states. In total, their range covers 18 countries in the Americas.</p>

<p>In the past, puma populations were widespread and abundant, but they have faced a variety of threats in recent decades. Habitat loss, hunting, and persecution by humans have all contributed to a decline in the puma population. According to a study by the Wildlife Conservation Society, pumas have been extirpated from half of their historical range.</p>

<p>The current global population of pumas is estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000. This figure is considered to be a minimum estimate, as it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of the total population due to the animalâ€™s elusive nature. It is believed that the population is declining due to continued habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict.</p>

<h2>The Puma Population in the U.S.</h2>

<p>Pumas are found in a variety of habitats throughout the United States, including in the western states of California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Utah, and Montana. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, there are an estimated 6,000-7,000 pumas in the United States.</p>

<p>In the United States, pumas are listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. This means that they are protected by law and it is illegal to hunt or harm them. As a result of conservation efforts, the puma population in the United States has been steadily increasing since 2000.</p>

<h2>The Puma Population in South America</h2>

<p>In South America, pumas are found in a variety of habitats, including in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. The puma population in South America is estimated to be between 10,000 and 20,000.</p>

<p>In South America, pumas have been heavily persecuted by humans for centuries due to their perceived threat to livestock. As a result, their numbers have declined drastically over the years. In recent decades, however, there have been some conservation efforts to protect pumas in the region.</p>

<h2>The Puma Population in Canada</h2>

<p>In Canada, pumas are found in parts of the Rocky Mountains and the coastal areas of British Columbia. Their population is estimated to be between 1,500 and 3,000. The puma population in Canada has been relatively stable in recent years, although there is evidence of some local declines due to habitat loss.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Pumas are an iconic species of the Americas and their populations have been declining in recent decades due to habitat loss, hunting, and persecution by humans. The current global population of pumas is estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000, with smaller populations in the United States, South America, and Canada.</p>
