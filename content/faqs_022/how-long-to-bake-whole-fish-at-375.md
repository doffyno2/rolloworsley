When it comes to preparing a delicious meal, baking a whole fish is a great way to get started. Baked fish is a healthy and flavorful option that can be enjoyed by all. But how long should you bake a whole fish at 375°F? The answer depends on the type of fish you are baking, as well as the size.

<h2>What Type of Fish Should You Bake?</h2>

When baking a whole fish, it is important to choose a type of fish that will cook properly. Some types of fish are better suited for baking than others. For example, white fish such as cod, haddock, and halibut are all excellent choices for baking. These types of fish have a mild flavor and flaky texture that will remain intact when cooked. Salmon, tuna, and mahi-mahi are also good options for baking.

<h2>How Long to Bake Whole Fish at 375°F?</h2>

The cooking time for a whole fish will depend on the size of the fish. Generally, a whole fish should be cooked for about 10 minutes per inch of thickness.

<h2>Tips for Baking a Whole Fish</h2>

Before baking the fish, it is important to season it. You can season the fish with salt, pepper, and any other seasonings you prefer. You can also add herbs, garlic, lemon juice, or other ingredients to the fish to add flavor.

Once the fish is seasoned, you can place it in a baking dish. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan before adding the fish. This will help to keep the fish from sticking to the pan. Place the fish in the preheated oven and bake for the amount of time determined by the size of the fish.
