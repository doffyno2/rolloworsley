Insulin is an essential drug for dogs with diabetes. Without it, a diabetic dog’s blood sugar levels can quickly become dangerously high. Unfortunately, insulin can be expensive, and many pet owners worry about how much it will cost to keep their dog healthy. This article will provide an overview of the cost of dog insulin in Australia.

<h2>What is Dog Insulin?</h2>

Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps regulate a dog’s blood sugar levels. Dogs with diabetes don’t produce enough insulin or can’t use it properly, so they need injections of synthetic insulin to keep their blood sugar levels in check.

<h2>How Much Does Dog Insulin Cost in Australia?</h2>

The cost of dog insulin in Australia varies depending on a number of factors, including the type of insulin, the size of the dog, and the dosage. Generally speaking, dog insulin in Australia can cost anywhere from $50 to $400 per month.

<h2>Types of Dog Insulin Available in Australia</h2>

There are several types of dog insulin available in Australia. The most commonly used insulin is known as U-40 insulin, which is a fast-acting insulin that lasts up to five hours. U-40 insulin is available in two forms: regular and NPH (neutral protamine hagedorn). Regular insulin is designed to be given immediately before a meal, while NPH insulin is designed to be given 12 hours before a meal.

<h2>Other Types of Dog Insulin</h2>

In addition to U-40 insulin, there are two other types of dog insulin available in Australia: Lantus and Levemir. Lantus is a long-acting insulin that lasts up to 24 hours and is designed to be given once a day. Levemir is a medium-acting insulin that lasts up to 18 hours and is designed to be given twice a day.
