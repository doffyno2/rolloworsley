<p>The Space Shuttle was one of the most advanced spacecraft ever designed. It was the first reusable spacecraft, and was capable of reaching speeds of up to 17,500 mph. It was also the first spacecraft to be launched into orbit by a large rocket, and could reach an altitude of up to 350 miles. The Space Shuttle was used by NASA for 30 years, and during its 30-year history, it flew 135 missions, making it one of the most successful spacecraft ever created.</p>

<h2>The Basics of Space Shuttle Travel</h2>

<p>The Space Shuttle had two main propulsion systems, a solid rocket booster and an external fuel tank. The solid rocket booster was used to launch the Shuttle from the launch pad and accelerate it to a speed of 17,500 mph. This speed is known as the orbital velocity and is necessary for the Shuttle to reach a stable orbit around the Earth. Once in orbit, the Shuttle's main engines would fire and slow it down to a lower speed in order to maintain its orbit. The Space Shuttle could stay in orbit for up to two weeks before it needed to be refueled or de-orbited.</p>

<h2>The Speed of the Space Shuttle During Launch</h2>

<p>During launch, the Space Shuttle reached a peak speed of 17,500 mph. This was the speed necessary for the Shuttle to reach a stable orbit around the Earth. This speed was so fast that the Shuttle could travel around the Earth in only 90 minutes. As the Shuttle reached its peak speed, it would be subjected to up to three times the force of gravity, which is known as g-force.</p>

<h2>The Speed of the Space Shuttle in Orbit</h2>

<p>In orbit, the Space Shuttle would travel at a much slower speed than during launch. This speed was necessary for the Shuttle to stay in orbit and not lose altitude. The Shuttle would travel at approximately 17,000 mph in low-Earth orbit and 25,000 mph in geosynchronous orbit. This slower speed was necessary in order for the Shuttle to stay in the same position relative to the Earth.</p>

<h2>The Speed of the Space Shuttle During Re-Entry</h2>

<p>During re-entry, the Space Shuttle would slow down to a speed of approximately 12,500 mph. This speed was necessary in order for the Shuttle to be able to enter the Earth's atmosphere without burning up. As the Shuttle entered the atmosphere, it would be subjected to up to five times the force of gravity, which is known as the re-entry g-force.</p>

<h2>The Speed of the Space Shuttle During Landing</h2>

<p>During landing, the Space Shuttle would slow down to a speed of approximately 250 mph. This speed was necessary for the Shuttle to be able to land safely on the runway. As the Shuttle approached the runway, it would be subjected to up to three times the force of gravity, which is known as the landing g-force.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Space Shuttle was the most advanced spacecraft ever designed. It was capable of reaching speeds of up to 17,500 mph during launch, and could stay in orbit for up to two weeks before it needed to be refueled or de-orbited. During re-entry, the Space Shuttle would slow down to a speed of approximately 12,500 mph, and during landing it would slow down to a speed of approximately 250 mph. The Space Shuttle was an incredible achievement in space exploration and was a testament to the ingenuity and hard work of the engineers and scientists who worked on it.</p>
