The Caribbean Sea is full of beautiful sandy beaches, crystal clear waters, and lush jungles, but it also contains two nations that have been in a state of political unrest for hundreds of years. The United States and Cuba have been involved in a long-standing dispute for many decades, and the island of Cuba is located just 90 miles off the coast of Florida. That begs the question, how many miles is it between Florida and Cuba? 

<h2>The Exact Distance Between Florida and Cuba</h2>

The exact distance between Florida and Cuba is approximately 90 miles. The two countries are separated by the Straits of Florida, which is a narrow strip of the Caribbean Sea located between Cuba and the United States. This strait is only about 22 miles wide at its narrowest point, and the total distance between Florida and Cuba is approximately 90 miles.

<h2>The History Behind the Florida-Cuba Relationship</h2>

The relationship between Florida and Cuba is a complicated one. In 1959, Fidel Castro overthrew the Cuban government and established a communist regime. This led to a decades-long political and economic embargo between the United States and Cuba, which is still in place today. For many years, Cuban-Americans living in Florida were not allowed to visit their families or business partners in Cuba. 

In 2014, the Obama administration began to ease the embargo, allowing American business owners and Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba for certain reasons. In 2016, the Obama administration further eased the embargo, and today, it is much easier for Americans to travel to Cuba. 

<h2>The Current Relationship Between Florida and Cuba</h2>

Although the embargo is still in place, the relationship between Florida and Cuba has improved significantly since the Obama administration eased the restrictions. Now, American tourists can travel to Cuba for educational and cultural purposes, and Cuban-Americans can visit their families and business partners in the country. 

Much of the improvement in the relationship is due to the fact that many Cuban-Americans living in Florida have been able to reconnect with their families in Cuba and gain a better understanding of the culture and politics of the island nation. 

<h2>The Economic Impact of Florida-Cuba Relations</h2>

The improved relationship between Florida and Cuba has also had a positive economic impact on both countries. In the United States, many companies have been able to take advantage of opportunities in Cuba, such as opening up hotels and restaurants, providing medical services, and selling goods and services to the Cuban people. 

In Cuba, the economy has been growing steadily since the Obama administration eased the embargo. Tourism has increased, and the Cuban government has been able to access foreign capital to invest in infrastructure projects. 

<h2>The Future of Florida-Cuba Relations</h2>

It is difficult to predict the future of Florida-Cuba relations, as it is still unclear how the current administration will approach the issue. However, many experts believe that the improving relationship between the two countries will continue, as both countries are seeing the economic and social benefits of closer ties.
