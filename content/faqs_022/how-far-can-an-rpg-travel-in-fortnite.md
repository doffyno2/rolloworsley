<p>Fortnite is one of the most popular battle royale games in the world, and it has quickly become a fan favorite. Players of all ages have enjoyed the game for its intense action, strategic team-based gameplay, and its wide array of weapons. One of the most iconic weapons in Fortnite is the rocket launcher or RPG, which can be used to take out enemies from a distance. But how far can an RPG travel in Fortnite?</p>

<p>The maximum distance an RPG can travel in Fortnite is around 600 meters (roughly 2,000 feet). This is due to the fact that Fortnite’s map is much smaller than other battle royale games, and the rocket launcher is limited to the size of the map. However, the distance an RPG can travel can be increased with the use of a scope, which allows players to view targets further away. Additionally, some players have developed techniques to increase the range of an RPG by using “jump shots”, which can increase the range of the rocket launcher. </p>

<p>In addition to its range, the rocket launcher itself can also be upgraded and modified to increase its effectiveness. Players can upgrade the damage and fire rate of the rocket launcher, as well as equip it with a scope or a silencer. Upgrading the rocket launcher and equipping it with attachments allows players to increase its range and effectiveness, making it a powerful and versatile weapon in Fortnite.</p>
