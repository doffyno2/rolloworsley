<p>Dungeons and Dragons (DD) is a fantasy role-playing game that has been around for decades. Players create a character and then go on adventures, fighting monsters and completing quests.

But how much health do they gain per level?</p> 

<h2>What Is Health in DD?</h2>

<p>Health, in DD, is an indication of the character's ability to withstand damage. It is determined by their class, level, and other factors.

As a character's HP is depleted, they become increasingly vulnerable to damage and can eventually die if their HP reaches zero.</p>

<h2>How Much Health Does a Character Gain Per Level?</h2>

<h2>How Can I Increase My Character's Health?</h2>

<h2>What Happens When My Character's Health Reaches Zero?</h2>
