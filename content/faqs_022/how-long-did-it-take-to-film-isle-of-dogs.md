Wes Anderson's 2018 stop-motion animated film Isle of Dogs has been highly praised by critics and audiences alike. The film is set in a dystopian future Japan, and follows a group of dogs who are banished to an island after an outbreak of canine flu. Anderson's unique visual style and storytelling prowess have become nearly synonymous with his name, and Isle of Dogs is no exception. But how long did it take to make this award-winning film?

<h2>Getting the Movie Off the Ground</h2>

It all started in 2014, when Anderson and his team began working on the concept for the movie. Development was slow going, as the film required the production of hundreds of miniature sets and puppet figures, as well as the coordination of many different actors and voiceover artists. After two years of hard work, Anderson and his team had a script and a plan for the film.

<h2>Making the Movie a Reality</h2>

Production on Isle of Dogs officially began in October 2016, with a crew of over 400 people working on the film. This included animators, puppet makers, set designers, voice actors, and many more. The total production time for the movie was estimated to be around 18 months. This may seem like a long time, but considering the complexity of the project, it's actually quite impressive.

<h2>The Animation Process</h2>

The animation process for Isle of Dogs was unique, as it used a combination of traditional stop-motion animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI). This allowed for more intricate details and smoother movements than traditional stop-motion animation. To achieve this effect, the team used both traditional hand-crafted figures and digitally-generated models.

<h2>The Voice Acting</h2>

One of the most impressive aspects of Isle of Dogs is the voice acting. The movie features an all-star cast, including Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum, Scarlett Johansson, and many more. To make sure each actor's performance was just right, the team recorded the voices in a studio in London.

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

All in all, the total production time for Isle of Dogs was 18 months. This included two years of development, followed by 16 months of production. The movie was then released in March 2018, to much critical and commercial acclaim.
