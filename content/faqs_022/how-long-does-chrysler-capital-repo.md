<p>Repossession is a process that Chrysler Capital uses if a customer fails to make timely payments on their loan or lease agreement.

<h2>How Long Does Chrysler Capital Repo Take?</h2>

<p>Chrysler Capital will typically try to contact the customer to discuss the past due payments and to find a solution.

This process can take a few days, depending on the customer's location and the availability of the vehicle. </p>

<p>Once the repossession process has been initiated, Chrysler Capital will notify the customer of the repossession.
