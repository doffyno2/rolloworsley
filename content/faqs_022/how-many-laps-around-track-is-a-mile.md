<p>If you’ve ever wondered how many laps around a track it takes to equal one mile, the answer is four. That’s right: four laps around a standard outdoor track with 400 meters in each lap will equal one mile. Of course, if you’re running indoors on a smaller track, the distance may vary slightly from this. But for the most part, it will still take four laps to equal one mile.</p>

<p>A standard outdoor track is 400 meters in length. This means that if you run one lap, you have run 400 meters. If you run two laps, you have run 800 meters. If you run three laps, you have run 1200 meters. And if you run four laps, you have run 1600 meters, which is the same as one mile.</p>

<p>For those who are familiar with a track, the basic measurement of four laps is fairly straightforward. But what if you’re new to the sport and unsure of how to measure the distance? Fortunately, there are a few helpful tricks you can use to make sure you’ve gone the full distance.</p>

<h2>Using a Stopwatch</h2>

<p>The easiest way to measure your laps is to use a stopwatch. Set the timer for four minutes and start running. Every time you reach the starting line, hit the lap button on the stopwatch. When the timer runs out, you will have run four laps and one mile.</p>

<h2>Using Markers</h2>

<p>If you don’t have a stopwatch, you can still measure your laps by using markers. Place four markers around the track, one at the starting line and one every 400 meters. Every time you reach a marker, check it off your list. When you have gone around the track four times and have checked off all four markers, you have run one mile.</p>

<h2>Using a GPS Watch</h2>

<p>For those who have access to a GPS watch, this is another great way to measure your laps and make sure you’ve gone the full mile. Simply set your watch to measure one mile and start running. The watch will track your progress and let you know when you’ve gone the full mile.</p>
