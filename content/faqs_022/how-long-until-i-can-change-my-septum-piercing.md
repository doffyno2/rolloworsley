Septum piercings are becoming increasingly popular. They are an edgy, fashionable piercing that can be done in a variety of places including the nose, cartilage, and even the septum. A septum piercing is located in the center of the nose, between the nostrils. It is a relatively simple procedure and does not take much time to complete.

However, once the piercing is complete, the question of when to change the jewelry becomes an issue. Changing the jewelry on a septum piercing can be a bit tricky, and it is important to wait until the piercing has fully healed before attempting to change out the jewelry.

<h2>What is a Septum Piercing?</h2>

A septum piercing is a type of body piercing that is located in the septum, which is the wall of cartilage that separates the nostrils. It is a popular piercing because it is relatively easy to get and can be done in a variety of locations. It is also a good option for people who want to get a piercing but do not want it to be visible.

<h2>How Long Does it Take to Heal?</h2>

The healing process for a septum piercing can take anywhere from four to eight weeks, depending on the individual and how well they take care of the piercing. During this time, it is important to properly care for the piercing in order to ensure that it heals properly. This includes cleaning the piercing regularly, avoiding contact with the piercing, and avoiding any activities that could cause the piercing to become irritated.

<h2>When Can I Change My Jewelry?</h2>
