<h2>What Is Dog Clipper Burn?</h2>

Dog clipper burn is a term used to describe the burning sensation that can occur when a clipper is used on a dog’s skin. It is caused when the blade of the clipper comes into contact with the skin, causing friction and heat. Dog clipper burn can range from mild to severe and can cause redness, swelling and pain.
