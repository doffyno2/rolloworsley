Symmetra, the brilliant Indian architect, is one of the most powerful heroes in Overwatch. Her ultimate ability, the Photon Barrier, is an incredibly powerful tool, able to protect her allies from incoming damage and even block off entire routes from the enemy. But just how much health does this barrier actually have?

<h2>What Is the Photon Barrier?</h2>

The Photon Barrier is Symmetra's ultimate ability, which she can activate to deploy a large energy shield in front of her. The barrier is an immense wall of energy that can block incoming damage and even block off entire routes. It can also be used to protect allies from enemy fire. The shield is incredibly powerful, and depending on the level of Symmetra's ultimate, it can have a lot of health.

<h2>How Much Health Does the Photon Barrier Have?</h2>

The exact amount of health the Photon Barrier has depends on the level of Symmetra's ultimate. At level one, the barrier has 600 health. At level two, it has 900 health. At level three, it has a whopping 1200 health. This means that even the strongest attacks will have difficulty breaking through the barrier, making it an invaluable asset in any fight.

<h2>How Long Does the Photon Barrier Last?</h2>

The Photon Barrier can last up to 20 seconds, depending on the level of Symmetra's ultimate. At level one, it will last for 20 seconds. At level two, it will last for 30 seconds. And at level three, it will last for a full 40 seconds. This gives Symmetra and her allies plenty of time to prepare for an attack, or to escape a dangerous situation.

<h2>What Are the Weaknesses of the Photon Barrier?</h2>

Though the Photon Barrier is incredibly powerful, it does have some weaknesses. For one, it does not block all forms of damage. Certain types of attacks, such as beam weapons, can still pass through the shield. Additionally, the shield can be destroyed by a large enough attack. This means that Symmetra and her allies should always be prepared for a possible breach.

<h2>How Can Symmetra's Photon Barrier Be Used Effectively?</h2>

Symmetra's Photon Barrier is an incredibly powerful tool, and can be used in a variety of ways. First, it can be used to protect allies from enemy fire. By using the barrier to block off entire routes, Symmetra can create a safe zone for her team to retreat to. Additionally, it can be used to trap enemies in a small area, making them easy targets for allies. Finally, it can be used to block off specific paths, allowing Symmetra and her allies to ambush enemies from unexpected angles.
