<p>Scooters are becoming increasingly popular as a low-cost, convenient way to get around. A 125cc scooter is one of the most popular models available, offering a blend of affordability and performance. But how many miles can a 125cc scooter last?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on a variety of factors. For example, the type of scooter, the condition of the scooter, and the way it is used all play a role in determining how many miles a scooter can last. On average, however, most 125cc scooters can last anywhere from 10,000 to 15,000 miles before requiring major maintenance or repairs.</p>

<p>The type of scooter you have can have a big impact on how many miles it will last. For example, a 125cc scooter with a manual transmission is likely to last longer than an automatic scooter. Manual scooters have fewer parts that can wear out over time, so they tend to last longer.</p>

<p>The condition of the scooter also affects its longevity. If the scooter is well maintained and regularly serviced, it is likely to last longer than a scooter that isn't. Regular oil changes, proper tire inflation, and other routine maintenance tasks can help extend the life of your scooter.</p>

<p>Finally, the way you use the scooter also affects how many miles it can last. If you ride it hard and fast, it is likely to wear out more quickly than if you ride it gently and responsibly. If you are going to be riding your scooter on a regular basis, it is important to follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule.</p>
