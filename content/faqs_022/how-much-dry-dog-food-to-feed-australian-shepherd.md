<p>When it comes to selecting the right amount of food for your Australian Shepherd, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. The best way to determine the right amount of food for your pup is to consult with your vet and consider the type of food you are providing.

<p>Dry food is often the preferred choice for Australian Shepherds. When selecting a dry food, look for one that is high in protein and low in carbohydrates.
