<p>When it comes to grilling, Traeger grills are among the best on the market. With the right care, they can last for years, but it’s important to know how long they’ll last and how to prolong their life. In this article, you’ll learn how long a full Traeger hopper should last and how to keep it working as long as possible.</p>

<h2>How Long Does a Traeger Hopper Last?</h2>

<p>The lifespan of a Traeger hopper depends on how well it’s maintained and how often it’s used. If a Traeger hopper is regularly cleaned and kept away from moisture, it can last for up to five years or more. If it’s not maintained, it will likely last for a much shorter amount of time. The hopper should be checked for rust, dirt, and other signs of wear and tear on a regular basis.</p>

<h2>How to Prolong the Life of a Traeger Hopper</h2>

<p>If you want to make sure your Traeger hopper lasts as long as possible, there are some steps you can take. First, make sure to clean the hopper regularly. This should be done at least once a month, and more often if the grill is used frequently. Use a brush to remove any dirt or debris that may have collected in the hopper. You should also check for rust and other signs of wear and tear.</p>

<p>Another way to make sure your Traeger hopper lasts is to keep it out of the elements. This means keeping it in a covered area or in a shed when it’s not in use. The hopper should also be stored in a dry place to avoid any moisture from getting inside and causing corrosion.</p>

<p>Finally, it’s important to make sure the hopper is properly lubricated. Traeger recommends using an oil-based lubricant, such as vegetable oil or canola oil. This should be done at least once a month, and more often if the hopper is used frequently.</p>

<h2>How to Tell When It’s Time to Replace a Traeger Hopper</h2>

<p>Eventually, the time will come when the Traeger hopper needs to be replaced. Signs that it’s time to replace the hopper include rust, damaged or worn parts, or a decrease in performance. If the hopper is not working properly, it’s time to replace it. It’s also a good idea to replace the hopper every five years or so, even if it’s still in good condition.</p>
