How Much Do Raccoon Dogs Cost?

Raccoon dogs are small, furry mammals native to East Asia. They are closely related to foxes and wolves, but their appearance makes them look more like a cross between a raccoon and a dog. Raccoon dogs have become popular pets in recent years, but how much do they cost? Letâ€™s take a look.



Raccoon dogs, also known as tanukis or tanuki dogs, are native to East Asia. They are small animals, usually weighing between 6 and 13 pounds, with a body that is between 12 and 20 inches long. They have a thick, luxurious fur coat that is usually grayish-brown in color, with patches of white and black. Raccoon dogs have a long, bushy tail and their feet are very similar to those of dogs, with five toes on each foot.

Raccoon dogs are pack animals and are often found in small family groups. They feed mainly on small animals, such as frogs, fish, rodents, and insects. They are also known to eat fruits, leaves, and berries. Raccoon dogs are mostly active at night, but they can be seen during the day if food is plentiful.



Raccoon dogs can make good pets, but they require a lot of work. They need a spacious enclosure that is safe and secure. Raccoon dogs should also be provided with plenty of toys and activities to keep them entertained.

Raccoon dogs are also not suitable for people who are away from home for long periods of time, as they require a lot of attention and interaction. Raccoon dogs should also not be kept as outdoor pets, as they are not adapted to cold climates and can easily succumb to the elements.



The cost of a raccoon dog can vary depending on a variety of factors, such as the age, size, and breed of the animal. On average, the cost of a raccoon dog can range from as little as $50 to as much as $1000.

The cost of a raccoon dog also depends on where you purchase it. For example, pet stores typically charge more for raccoon dogs than breeders or private sellers. The cost of food, bedding, and other supplies should also be taken into account when calculating the total cost of owning a raccoon dog.



In addition to the initial purchase price of the raccoon dog, there are other costs to consider. These include the cost of veterinary care, food, bedding, toys, and other supplies. Veterinary care can be expensive, and it is important to remember that raccoon dogs require regular checkups and vaccinations.

In addition, raccoon dogs require a lot of time and attention. Owners should be prepared to spend time and money on training, socializing, and exercising their pet.



Raccoon dogs can make great pets for people who have the time, space, and resources to devote to them. However, it is important to remember that they are not suitable for everyone and that the cost of owning a raccoon dog can add up quickly. Before deciding to get a raccoon dog, it is important to do some research and make sure that you can provide the animal with a safe and comfortable environment.
