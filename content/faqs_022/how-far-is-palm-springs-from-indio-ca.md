With so much to see and do in both cities, many visitors are wondering how far is Palm Springs from Indio CA?</p>

<p>The answer to this question depends on a few factors. The most direct route between the two cities is to take California State Route 111, which runs along the foothills of the Santa Rosa Mountains. This route is approximately 45 miles in length and will take you about an hour and a half to drive depending on traffic. If you decide to take I-10, this route is slightly longer but quicker as it is a straight shot from Palm Springs to Indio.</p>
