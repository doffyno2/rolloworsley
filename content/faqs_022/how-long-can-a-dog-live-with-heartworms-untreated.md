Heartworms are a serious and potentially life-threatening condition for dogs. While there are treatments available, it is important to understand the risks and what can happen if the condition is left untreated. The good news is that with prompt and proper treatment, most dogs can live a normal life with heartworm disease. However, if left untreated, it can be fatal.

<h2>What Are Heartworms?</h2>

Heartworms are parasitic worms that live in the heart, lungs, and blood vessels of an infected dog. They are transmitted by mosquitoes, which bite and inject immature larvae into the dog's bloodstream. The larvae then migrate to the heart, lungs and other organs, where they grow and mature into adult worms.

<h2>What Are the Symptoms of Heartworm Disease?</h2>

The most common symptom of heartworm disease is a persistent cough. Other symptoms include difficulty breathing, tiredness, weight loss, and a decreased appetite. In advanced cases, the dog may show signs of congestive heart failure, such as an enlarged abdomen, a pot-bellied appearance, and pale gums.

<h2>How Is Heartworm Disease Diagnosed?</h2>

Heartworm disease should be diagnosed as soon as possible. This can be done with a combination of tests. The most common is a blood test to look for heartworm antigen. Other tests include chest X-rays, ultrasound, and an echocardiogram.

<h2>How Is Heartworm Disease Treated?</h2>

The treatment for heartworm disease involves killing the adult worms in the heart and lungs. This is done with a combination of medications, including an adulticide and a heartworm preventive. In some cases, the dog may also require surgery to remove the worms.

<h2>What Happens if Heartworm Disease is Left Untreated?</h2>

If heartworm disease is left untreated, the worms can cause serious damage to the heart and lungs. This can lead to heart failure, lung disease, and even death. In addition, the worms can block the airways, leading to difficulty breathing.

<h2>How Long Can a Dog Live With Heartworms Untreated?</h2>

Unfortunately, it is impossible to predict how long a dog can live with heartworms untreated. The severity of the disease and the size of the worm population will determine the prognosis. In general, if left untreated, most dogs will die within 6 months to 2 years.

<h2>Can Heartworm Disease Be Prevented?</h2>

Fortunately, heartworm disease can be prevented with regular use of a heartworm preventive. This medication kills the larvae before they can develop into adult worms. It is important to give the medication to your dog on a regular basis, as recommended by your veterinarian.
