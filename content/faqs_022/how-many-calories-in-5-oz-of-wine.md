<p>When it comes to enjoying a glass of wine, many people often wonder how many calories are in 5 oz of wine. After all, you don't want to have too many calories when drinking and you certainly don't want to go overboard. So, what is the answer?</p>

<p>The answer to this question actually depends on the type of wine you are drinking. Generally speaking, a 5-ounce glass of red wine typically contains around 120 calories, while a 5-ounce glass of white wine usually contains around 100 calories. Of course, these numbers may vary depending on the type of wine, the sweetness level, and the alcohol content.</p>

<p>For instance, a sweeter wine, such as Riesling, will usually have more calories than a drier wine such as Pinot Grigio. Similarly, a higher alcohol content wine will usually have more calories than a lower alcohol content wine. So, if you are unsure how many calories are in 5 oz of wine, it would be best to check the label on the bottle to get an accurate number.</p>

<h2>What Are The Health Benefits of Drinking Wine?</h2>

Of course, it is important to note that these health benefits only apply to those who drink in moderation, which is defined as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men.</p>

<h2>What Are The Potential Risks of Drinking Too Much Wine?</h2>
