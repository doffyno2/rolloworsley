<h2>Introducing New Sod to Your Lawn</h2>

Adding new sod to your lawn can be an exciting and rewarding experience. Not only is it great for aesthetic purposes, but it also helps to improve the overall health of your lawn. Plus, it can help to protect and preserve your lawn for years to come. But before you lay down that new sod, there are a few things you need to know about how long to keep your dogs off the new sod. 

Sod is essentially a roll of grass that is already grown and ready to be laid down on your soil. It is usually composed of multiple types of grass, such as Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, or a combination of all of these. When you lay down sod, it will take a few weeks for it to take root and start to grow. This is why it’s so important to keep your dogs off the new sod for a few weeks.

<h2>Why You Need to Keep Dogs off the New Sod</h2>

Dogs naturally love to run, dig, and play in the yard. But when you have new sod in your yard, it’s important to keep your dogs off it until it has had a chance to take root and start growing. The new sod is delicate and fragile, and it won’t be able to withstand the weight of your dog’s paws if they run and play on it too much. This can cause the sod to become damaged and potentially die before it has a chance to take root and start growing. 

<h2>How Long to Keep Dogs off New Sod?</h2>

So, how long should you keep your dogs off the new sod? The answer to this question depends on a few factors, including the type of sod you have laid down and the climate you live in. Generally speaking, you should keep your dogs off the new sod for at least two weeks. This will give the sod enough time to take root and start growing. Once it has taken root and started to grow, you can then start to slowly introduce your dogs back into the yard. 

<h2>Introducing Dogs to New Sod</h2>

Once the new sod has had a few weeks to take root and start growing, you can then start to slowly introduce your dogs back into the yard.

After a few days, you can then start to allow your dogs to spend some time in the yard. Give them plenty of time to run and play, but make sure they stay away from the new sod.
