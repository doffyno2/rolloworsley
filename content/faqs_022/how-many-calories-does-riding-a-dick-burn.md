How Many Calories Does Riding a Dick Burn?

When it comes to sex, it’s no secret that it can be a great way to burn calories. But just how many calories you can burn during sex may vary depending on the type of sex you’re having. That’s why it’s important to understand the calorie-burning potential of different sexual activities. In this article, we’ll take a look at the calorie-burning potential of riding a dick.



Riding a dick, also known as cowgirl or reverse cowgirl, is a form of sex in which the partner on top straddles the partner on the bottom. This allows the partner on top to control the speed, angle, and depth of penetration. It’s a popular sexual position for many couples because it can be very pleasurable for both partners.



The exact number of calories you can burn riding a dick may vary depending on your size, weight, and how vigorously you’re thrusting. That being said, it’s estimated that you can burn between 85 and 135 calories per half hour of riding a dick. This is a significant amount of calories, especially if you’re having sex for an extended period of time.



Riding a dick can be a great way to burn calories and get a good workout. It also has other benefits, such as improved cardiovascular health, increased flexibility, and improved balance. Plus, it’s a great way to build intimacy and connection with your partner.



If you’re looking to maximize the calorie-burning potential of riding a dick, there are a few tips you can keep in mind. First, focus on making your movements slow and controlled. This will help you engage more of your muscles and burn more calories.

Second, try to engage your core muscles to help stabilize your body. This will help you move more efficiently and burn more calories.

Finally, don’t be afraid to experiment with different angles and depths of penetration. This can help you target different muscles and burn more calories.
