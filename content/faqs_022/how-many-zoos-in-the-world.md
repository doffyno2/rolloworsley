<p>It is estimated that there are over 10,000 zoos in the world today. This number is constantly changing as new zoos open and old zoos close. In addition to traditional zoos, there are also safari parks, aquariums, and other wildlife parks that offer visitors the opportunity to observe and interact with animals in their natural environment.</p>

<p>Zoos have been around since ancient times, although the modern zoo did not become popular until the 19th century. The first modern zoo, the Zoological Garden of Vienna, opened in 1752 and was followed by other major zoos in London, Paris, and Berlin. Today, zoos can be found in almost every country around the world.</p>

<p>The number of animals held in captivity varies greatly from zoo to zoo. Some are home to hundreds of species, while others may only have a few dozen. The number of individual animals held in captivity varies even more, with some zoos having tens of thousands of animals on display.</p>

<p>Many of the world's zoos are part of larger organizations such as the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA). WAZA is a global organization that works to promote conservation and the humane treatment of animals in captivity. WAZA is also responsible for the promotion of public education and awareness of the importance of zoos.</p>

<p>Zoos have become increasingly popular in recent years, with many offering educational programs and activities for visitors. Some zoos even host special events such as animal shows and demonstrations. As the popularity of zoos continues to grow, it is likely that the number of zoos in the world will also continue to increase.</p>

<h2>What Is The Purpose Of Zoos?</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of zoos is to provide a safe and controlled environment for animals to live and breed. Zoos are also important for public education, helping to raise awareness of the plight of endangered species and the importance of conservation. Many zoos also assist in global conservation efforts, such as captive breeding programs and reintroduction of threatened species into the wild.</p>

<p>Zoos are also an important source of research for many different fields, including animal behavior, ecology, and conservation biology. By studying animals in captivity, scientists can gain valuable insight into their behavior and physiology that can be used to better understand and protect wild populations.</p>

<h2>How Are Zoos Regulated?</h2>

<p>The regulation of zoos differs from country to country. In the United States, zoos are regulated by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The AZA sets standards for the care and welfare of animals in zoos, including minimum standards for housing, nutrition, health care, and enrichment. All zoos in the United States must be accredited by the AZA in order to operate.</p>

<p>In the United Kingdom, zoos are regulated by the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. This act sets standards for the care and welfare of animals in zoos, as well as minimum standards for housing, nutrition, health care, and enrichment. All zoos must be licensed by the local authority in order to operate.</p>

<h2>What Are The Pros And Cons Of Zoos?</h2>

<p>Zoos have both pros and cons. On the one hand, they provide a safe and controlled environment for animals to live and breed, and they can be an important source of research for many different fields. They also provide educational opportunities for the public to learn about animals and the importance of conservation. On the other hand, there are concerns about the welfare of animals in captivity, as well as the potential for disease transmission between captive and wild populations.</p>
