The cost of an AC section for a small dog varies depending on several different factors. The most important factor is the size and breed of the dog.

Additionally, you should inquire about any additional fees that may be associated with the procedure, such as anesthesia or medication.

Once you have gathered quotes from different veterinarians, you can compare the prices and determine which one offers the best value for your money.
