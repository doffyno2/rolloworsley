<p>Aarons will send out a repossession team to your home to collect the item in question. The repossession team will show you a copy of the repossession letter and will collect the item, either by taking it away or by placing it in storage. Aarons does not need a court order to repossess your items.</p> 

<h2>How Long Does it Take for Aarons to Repo?</h2>
