Foggy windows are a common problem in homes and business premises. The foggy appearance is caused by moisture build-up between the two glass panes of a window. This problem is not only unsightly, but it can also lead to energy loss, leaving the house colder during winter months and making it harder to keep the interior temperature comfortable. Fortunately, foggy windows can easily be repaired, and the cost of repair depends on the method used.

Foggy windows are caused by moisture that builds up between the two glass panes in a window. This build-up of moisture can occur due to a number of reasons.

Other potential causes include condensation, poor ventilation, and age. 

<h2>How To Tell If Your Windows Are Foggy</h2>

If you think your windows may be foggy, there are a few ways to tell. The most obvious sign is a hazy or cloudy appearance on the glass.
