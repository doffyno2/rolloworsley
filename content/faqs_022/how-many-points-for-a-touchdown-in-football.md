Football is one of the most popular sports in the world. It is an exciting game that requires a lot of skill and strategy. But, how many points are awarded for a touchdown in football?

The answer is simple: six points. A touchdown is awarded to the team that crosses the opponent's goal line with the ball, or catches a pass in the end zone. The team that scores the most points wins the game.

<h2>How are Points Awarded in Football?</h2>

In football, points are awarded for various accomplishments. The most common way to score points is by crossing the goal line with the ball, or catching a pass in the end zone. This action is called a touchdown and is worth six points.

Other ways to score points include kicking a field goal or extra point. A field goal is worth three points, while an extra point is worth one point. Teams can also score two points by executing a successful two-point conversion. 

<h2>What is a Two-Point Conversion?</h2>

A two-point conversion is an attempt to score two points instead of one. It requires the offensive team to run or pass the ball into the end zone from the two-yard line. If they are successful, they are awarded two points. If they fail, they are not awarded any points. 

<h2>How Many Points are Awarded for Other Plays?</h2>

Kicking a field goal or extra point is worth three points or one point, respectively. Safety, which is when the defensive team tackles an offensive player in the end zone, is worth two points. Additionally, teams can score one point by kicking the ball through the uprights on a free kick.

<h2>What Happens if the Score is Tied at the End of the Game?</h2>

If the score is tied at the end of the fourth quarter, the game goes into overtime. In overtime, both teams get a chance to try and score points. If one team scores and the other does not, that team is awarded the win. If both teams score, the game is declared a tie.
