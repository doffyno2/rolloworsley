<p>When it comes to leaving feedback on eBay, one of the most common questions is “How long can you leave feedback on eBay?” This is an important question to ask, as feedback is an important part of the eBay community and is a key component to successful selling and buying. Without feedback, buyers and sellers wouldn’t know who to trust, so it’s important to know how long feedback can be left on the site. We’ll look at the different types of feedback, how long it can be left, and what happens if feedback isn’t left in a timely manner.</p>

<h2>Types of Feedback on eBay</h2>

<p>When it comes to feedback on eBay, there are two types: Positive and Negative. Positive feedback is an indication that the buyer was satisfied with the purchase. It helps to boost the seller’s reputation and encourages other buyers to shop with them. Negative feedback is an indication that the buyer was not satisfied with the purchase. It can be damaging to a seller’s reputation and can discourage other buyers from shopping with them.</p>

<h2>How Long Can You Leave Feedback on eBay?</h2>

<p>The short answer to the question “How long can you leave feedback on eBay?” is that you have 30 days from the time of purchase to leave feedback. This is true for both positive and negative feedback. If feedback is not left within 30 days, then the feedback will not be counted towards the seller’s rating.</p>

<h2>Can You Change or Remove Feedback on eBay?</h2>

<p>Yes, you can change or remove feedback on eBay. To do so, you should contact eBay customer service and explain why you want to change or remove your feedback. They may be able to help you out, but it is ultimately up to them whether or not they will allow your request.

It is important to note that leaving feedback after the 30 day period is not necessarily a bad thing.
