<p>The Voyager 1 spacecraft has been traveling through space since 1977 and is the farthest man-made object from Earth. It is currently the fastest spacecraft in history and is the only one to have left our solar system. Voyager 1 is traveling at a speed of more than 35,000 mph (17 kilometers per second) as it moves away from the Sun. This incredible speed is due to the spacecraft's powerful thrusters, which were used to propel it away from Earth and into space. Voyager 1 is now more than 11 billion miles away from the sun and is expected to reach interstellar space in the near future.</p>

<h2>How Did Voyager 1 Reach Such High Speeds?</h2>

<p>The Voyager 1 spacecraft is powered by a set of three large thrusters that are used to accelerate and decelerate the spacecraft. The thrusters are powered by a nuclear-powered generator, which provides enough energy for the thrusters to propel the spacecraft up to speeds of more than 35,000 mph. The thrusters use a combination of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as fuel, which provide the necessary thrust to move the spacecraft through space. The thrusters are also used to turn the spacecraft in order to change its direction, as well as to slow it down when it needs to slow down.</p>

<h2>How Far Has Voyager 1 Traveled?</h2>

<p>Since its launch in 1977, the Voyager 1 spacecraft has traveled more than 11 billion miles away from the sun. It is currently the farthest man-made object from Earth and is expected to reach interstellar space in the near future. After Voyager 1 reaches interstellar space, it will continue to move through space at its current speed until its nuclear power supply runs out, which is estimated to be around the year 2020. At that point, the spacecraft will be traveling at a speed of more than 35,000 mph.</p>

<h2>What Is Voyager 1's Mission?</h2>

<p>The Voyager 1 spacecraft was launched with the mission of exploring the outer reaches of our solar system and beyond. It is equipped with a set of scientific instruments and cameras that are used to study and observe the objects it encounters. Voyager 1 has already made some incredible discoveries, such as finding evidence of a previously unknown ring around Uranus, as well as discovering active volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io. The spacecraft is also taking images of distant stars and galaxies, as well as collecting data on the interstellar medium.</p>

<h2>What Is Voyager 1's Future?</h2>

<p>The future of Voyager 1 is uncertain at this point. The spacecraft is currently traveling at a speed of more than 35,000 mph and is expected to reach interstellar space in the near future. After that, it will continue to move through space until its nuclear power supply runs out, which is estimated to be around the year 2020. At that point, the spacecraft will be traveling at a speed of more than 35,000 mph and will be beyond the reach of Earth's radio transmissions.</p>
