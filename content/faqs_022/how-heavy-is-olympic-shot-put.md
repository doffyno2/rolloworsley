<p>The Olympic shot put is one of the most popular Olympic track and field events. It involves athletes throwing a heavy metal ball, called a shot put, as far as possible. The shot put has been part of the Olympic Games since 1896, and is one of the oldest track and field events in the world. But how heavy is an Olympic shot put?</p>

<p>The weight of an Olympic shot put is 16 pounds (7.26kg). This is the standard weight for men and women in Olympic competition. The weight of the shot put also differs depending on the age of the competitor. For example, Junior Olympic competitors throw shots that weigh 8.8 pounds (4kg), while youth Olympic competitors throw shots that weigh 6.6 pounds (3kg).</p>

<p>The size of the shot put also differs slightly depending on the competition. In Olympic competition, the shot put must measure 4.7 inches (12cm) in diameter. However, in Junior Olympic competition, the shot put measures 4.3 inches (11cm) in diameter, while in youth Olympic competition, the shot put measures 4.1 inches (10.5cm) in diameter.</p>

<p>The event has seen much innovation over the years, with the introduction of new techniques and technologies to improve performance. For example, in the 1940s, the first cork-filled shot put was introduced, which reduced the weight of the shot put and improved its aerodynamics. Other innovations included the use of the glide technique in the 1970s, which allowed athletes to throw the shot put farther than ever before.</p>

<h2>Technique of the Shot Put</h2>
