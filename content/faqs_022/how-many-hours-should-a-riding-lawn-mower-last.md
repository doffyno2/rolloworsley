Additionally, if you mow in challenging conditions, such as overgrown grass or in wet, muddy conditions, your mower is more likely to wear down faster. </p>

<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p>The amount of maintenance you do on your riding lawn mower is important. Regular oil changes, blade sharpening, and other maintenance tasks can help extend the life of your mower. It’s also important to store your mower in a dry, sheltered area to protect it from the elements. </p>
